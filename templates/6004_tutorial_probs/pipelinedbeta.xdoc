<img src="star.gif" alt="Discussed in section"/>
In a 5-stage pipelined Beta, when does the hardware use its
ability to insert NOP into the instruction stream at the IF stage
(using the MUX controlled by Annul<sup>IF</sup>)?

<q:answer>
A NOP is inserted in the IF stage when annulling instructions in the
branch delay slot because of a taken branch or when flushing the
pipeline due to a fault in the ALU or MEM stages.

In a 5-stage pipelined Beta, when does the hardware use its
ability to insert a NOP into the instruction stream at the ALU stage
(using the MUX controlled by Annul<sup>ALU</sup>)?

<q:answer>
If a fault occurs in the MEM stage (eg, illegal memory address), the
instruction currently in the ALU stage needs to be discarded, which
the hardware does by substituting a NOP.  Note that a fault in the MEM
stage discards all the instructions currently in the IF, RF and ALU
stages since they
logically come <i>after</i> the instruction which caused the fault.

<img src="star.gif" alt="Discussed in section"/>
Ben Bitdiddle is thinking about modifying a 5-stage pipelined
Beta to add a "Jump if Memory Zero" instruction (JMZ) that fetches
the contents of a memory location and jumps if the fetched value
is zero.  How many branch delay slots would follow a JMZ instruction
in the modified 5-stage pipelined Beta?

<q:answer>
The contents of the memory location accessed by JMZ aren't available
until the instruction reaches the WB stage.  If the branch decision
is made at that point, instructions in MEM, ALU, RF and IF have
already been fetched -- so there are 4 branch delay slots.

</q:answer>
</q:subquestion>
<q:subquestion>
Suppose the following code were running on a Beta implementation
with a 5-stage pipeline, full bypassing and 1 branch delay slot with
annulment.

<pre>PUSH (R1)
PUSH (R2)
LD (BP, -12, R0)
LD (BP, -16, R1)
CMPEQ (R0, R1, R2)
BT (R2, L1)
</pre>

When the CMPEQ is executed, assuming no interrupts, where does the
value for R0 come from?  How about the value for R1? (The choices
would be from the register file or bypassed from one of the pipeline
stages.)

<q:answer>
The CMPEQ instruction stalls in the RF stage until values for both R0
and R1 are available.  The value for R1 isn't available until the second
LD reaches the WB stage at which point the results from the first LD
have already been written into the register file.  So R0 comes from
the register file and R1 is bypassed from the WB stage.

<img src="star.gif" alt="Discussed in section"/>
Which of the following pipeline hazards cannot be dealt with
transparently and at no performance cost by bypassing?

<ol type="A">
<li>A shared register between consecutive ALU instructions.</li>
<li>A BR followed by an ALU instruction using the BR.</li>
<li>An LD followed by an ALU instruction using the LD.</li>
<li>Access to LP by the first instruction in a called procedure.</li>
<li>Access to XP by the first instruction in an interrupt handler.</li>
</ol>

<q:answer>
(C) Since the data from an LD instruction isn't available until the
WB stage, bypassing can't help.

The number of branch delay slots reflects
<ol type="A">
<li>The distance between the instruction fetch stage and the stage at which the branch decision is made.</li>
<li>The distance between the writeback stage and the stage at which the branch decision is made.</li>
<li>The total length of the pipeline.</li>
<li>The position within the pipeline of the instruction fetch stage.</li>
<li>The number of cycles required for a fetch from data memory.</li>
</ol>

<q:answer>
(A) The number of branch delay slots refers to the number of instructions following
a branch that are fetched by the pipeline before the branch decision is made.

<q:question>
A common method for communicating with input and
output devices is to assign them to one or more memory addresses. This
technique is called memory-mapped I/O.  Some I/O locations are used to
address status words that indicate the availability of an associated
I/O device. These status words indicate if an input device has new
input information available, or if an output device has processed its
previous output request. Often, computers will execute tight loops
waiting for the status of an I/O device. Consider the following
instruction sequence for checking the status of an external I/O
device.

<pre>loop: LD(R31, status, R0)
      BEQ(R0, loop, R31)
      ADD (R0, R1, R2)
</pre>

<p/>The following pipeline diagram illustrates the execution of this
instruction sequence on a standard 5-stage pipelined Beta:.

How many clock cycles does it take to execute one iteration of the
2-instruction loop given?

<q:answer>
5 clocks.  Measuring from the LD instruction of one iteration to the
LD instruction of the next, we get five cycles.

</q:subquestion>
<q:subquestion>
<img src="star.gif" alt="Discussed in section"/>
What aspect of the instruction sequence causes NOP1 to be
inserted into the pipeline?

<q:answer>
The RA field of the BEQ matched the RC field of the LD in the ALU
stage.  BEQ is testing the value in R0 which was the destination for
the preceeding LD instruction.  The memory data being accessed by LD
won't be available to the Beta until the LD instruction reaches the WB
stage.  So the hardware let's the LD instruction progress through the
pipeline while stalling the BEQ instruction in the RF stage until the
necessary data is available.  The "gap" that opens between the two
instructions is filled with NOPs (in this case, NOP1 and NOP2).

</q:answer>
</q:subquestion>
<q:subquestion>
<img src="star.gif" alt="Discussed in section"/>
What aspect of the instruction sequence causes NOP2 to be
inserted into the pipeline?

<q:answer>
The RA field of the BEQ matched the RC field of the LD in the MEM stage.

</q:subquestion>
<q:subquestion>
<img src="star.gif" alt="Discussed in section"/>
What aspect of the instruction sequence causes NOP3 to be
inserted into the pipeline?

<q:answer>
All taken BEQ instructions cause NOPs to be inserted.  We have chosen
to annul instructions that follow taken branches.  This is
accomplished by in the IF stage by replacing annulling instructions
with NOPs.

</q:answer>
</q:subquestion>
<q:subquestion>
In a non-standard version of the 5-stage pipelined Beta,
<b>where the instruction following a branch is not annulled</b>, which of
the following statements would be true?

<li>The loop would still take 5 cycles to execute</li>
<li>The value of the register R0 that is tested by the BEQ instruction comes from a by-pass path</li>

Consider execution of the following code sequence on our pipelined Beta processor:

<pre>ADDC(R31, 3, R0)
SUBC(R0, 1, R1)
MUL(R0, R1, R2)
XOR(R0, R2, R3)

<q:question>
Flaky Betas Inc.'s purchasing agent, Penny Pincher, has acquired a
large number of 5-stage pipelined Betas with full bypass and 1
annulled branch delay slot (the FB3).  These processors have a single
flaw: the connection of the PC inputs to the WDSEL multiplexor is
defective.  Penny is proud of the deal she made, but the FBI software
team points out that procedure calls are broken since the write to the
LP register uses the broken path.

<p/>After a moment's thought, Penny proposes that a call to a nearby
procedure f, rather than generating a BR(f,LP)be compiled as:

<pre>LDR(.+8,LP)
BR(f,r31)
LONG(.+4)
</pre>

<q:subquestion>
Which of the following is the best statement about Penny's scheme?

<ol type="A">
<li>it works</li>
<li>it will work only if the return sequence from a procedure is
modified to add 4 to the value of LP before executing a JMP(LP) to
return to the caller</li>
<li>doesn't work since the LDR instruction is also broken by the flaw
in the FB3's data path</li>
<li>only works if the program is placed in the bottom 32767 words of
main memory.</li>
<li>doesn't work</li>
</ol>

<q:answer>
(A) The LDR loads the address of the instruction following the LONG()
into LP, so when the procedure returns, execution resumes at the
correct point

</q:answer>
</q:subquestion>
<q:subquestion>
Whether Penny's proposed scheme works or not, the software team
doesn't like it and demands another solution.  Penny remembers that
all of the bypass paths in the Beta design are still operational
except for the one at the last (write back) stage.

<p/>On a procedure call, during the cycle in which the first
instruction of the called procedure is in the RF pipeline stage, where
in the 5-stage Beta pipeline is the return address?

<q:answer>
In the memory pipeline stage.  Instruction sequence is BR, annulled
instruction, first instruction of procedure, i.e., the BR is two
stages further along the pipeline.


</q:answer>
</q:subquestion>
<q:subquestion>
Assuming that all procedures are compiled with a standard entry
and exit code sequence and that we don't need to worry about
interrupts, does the fact that the bypass paths still work help Penny
generate another solution?

<q:answer>
Yes!  But the entry sequence will have to be modified by adding
ADDC(LP,0,LP) as the first instruction to keep from loosing the value
because of the FB3 flaw.  Adding this instruction bypasses the value
of LP from the M stage (see answer to (B) above) just before it gets mashed
by the broken path.

<q:question>
Pipelines-R-Us, a processor-design consulting firm located in the
Valley, has submitted the following proposal to the 6.004 staff.  They
have noticed that the MEMORY stage of the five-stage pipelined Beta
isn't used except during load and store operations.  They propose
omitting that stage entirely whenever the memory isn't used, as
illustrated by the following table showing how an instruction travels
through the various pipeline stages in succeeding cycles:

<p/><img src="pipelinedbeta08.gif"/>

<p/>P-R-U reasons that instructions that leave out the MEM stage can
complete a cycle earlier and thus most programs will run 20% faster!

<p/>In your answers below assume that both the original and the P-R-U
pipelined implementations are fully bypassed.

<q:subquestion>
Explain briefly to P-R-U why decreasing the latency of a single
instruction does not necessarily have an impact on the throughput of
the processor.  Hint: consider how long it would take the original
pipelined Beta to complete a sequence of 1000 ADDs.  Then compare that
with how long a P-R-U-modified Beta would take to complete the same
sequence.

<q:answer>
In the original pipelined Beta it will take 5 clock periods (T) to
complete the first ADD and then 999T to complete the rest.  Thus the
total time to process 1000 ADDs will be 1004T.  In the P-R-U modified
Beta it will take 4T for the first ADD and 999T for the rest.  So the
total time for this "improved" Beta to complete 1000 ADDs will be
1003T, which is not much improvement over the regular pipelined Beta.

</q:answer>
</q:subquestion>
<q:subquestion>
Consider a sequence of alternating LD and ADD instructions.  Assuming
that the LD instructions use different source and destination
registers than the ADD instructions (i.e., there are no stalls
introduced due to data dependencies), what is the instruction
completion rate of the original, unmodified 5-stage Beta pipeline?

<q:answer>
With no stalls, the original Beta completes alternating LDs and ADDs
at one instruction per clock period T.

</q:answer>
</q:subquestion>
<q:subquestion>
Now show how the same sequence of instructions will perform on a
processor modified as P-R-U has suggested.  Assume that the hardware
will stall an instruction if it requires a pipeline stage that is
currently being used by a previous instruction.  For example, if two
instructions both want to use the WB pipeline stage in the same cycle,
the instruction that started later will be forced to wait a cycle.
Draw a pipeline diagram showing where the stalls need to be introduced
to prevent pipe stage conflicts.

<q:answer>
If an instruction that uses all 5 stages (such as LD/ST/etc.) is
executed right before an instruction that only uses 4 stages
(ADD/SUB/etc.) then the second instruction will have to be stalled
because the WB stage is in use and thus cannot be used at the same
time by the second instruction.  For example:

<pre>
foo:	LONG( 0 )

	LD( foo, R0 )
	ADD( R1, R2, R3 )
</pre>

To execute this sequence correctly the pipeline diagram must look like
this:

<p/><img src="pipelinedbeta09.gif"/>

<p/>The stall occurs when the ADD and the LD attempt to use the WB stage
at the same time, forcing the ADD instruction to remain in a wait
stage during t5.

</q:answer>
</q:subquestion>
<q:subquestion>
Did P-R-U's idea improve performance?  Why or why not?

<q:answer>
If all we ever executed were single 4-stage instructions such as one
ADD, then P-R-U's idea would improve latency by 20%.  In reality,
however, we execute programs with many instructions.  If these
instructions are all 4-stage instructions, then, as shown in part (A)
the performance improvement is insignificant.  If these instructions
are intermixed 4-stage and 5-stage instructions, then, as shown in
part (C), there isn't any performance improvement.

<q:question>
Bargain Betas, Inc specializes in selling slightly defective Beta
processors to budget-minded customers who are willing to program
around the defects.  BBI has acquired rights to the design of the
Buba, a slightly defective version of the 5-stage pipelined Beta from
lecture.  The Buba differs only in its having no bypass logic or
branch delay slot annulling.

<p/>You try running three little test sequences on the Buba, starting
in each case with R1= -1, R2 = 1, R3 = 5, and R4 = -1:

<pre>S1: 	ADD(R1, R2, R3)
	SUB(R2, R3, R4)
	CMPLT(R3, R4, R5)

S2: 	ADD(R1, R2, R3)
	NOP
	SUB(R2, R3, R4)
	NOP
	CMPLT(R3, R4, R5)

S3: 	ADD(R1, R2, R3)
	NOP
	SUB(R2, R3, R4)
	CMPLT(R3, R4, R5)
</pre>

<q:subquestion>
For each of the above sequences, give the value to be found in R5 (i)
after execution on a working Beta and (ii) after execution on a Buba.
Explain your answers.

<q:answer>
In the Buba, a 5-stage pipeline without bypass logic, the result of an
instruction will not be available to be read (in the Register File
stage) until 4 clock cyles later. So for instance, if a certain
instruction writes a value to R0, that value cannot be used by the
next 3 instructions (they will all be reading the previous value of
R0). The fourth instruction (following the original instruction) is
the first that will be able to read the new value of R0. So, for
instance, consider the following code:

<pre>ADDC(R31, 10, RO)
SUBC(R0, 5, R1)
ANDC(R0, 6, R2)
ORC(R0, 7, R3)
CMPLTC(R0, 11, R4)
</pre>

<img src="pipelinedbeta10.gif"/>

<p/>The CMPLTC will be the first instruction to fetch the new value of
R0. All the preceding instructions will be using the previous value(s)
of R0. The ADDC instruction is in the Write Back stage while ORC is in
the Register File stage-so the new R0 is not written back in time for
the ORC to read it.

<p/>For the working Beta, S1, S2, and S3 all compute the same results.
Initially: Reg[ R1 ] = -1, Reg[ R2 ] = 1, Reg[ R3 ] = 5, Reg[ R4 ] = -1

<pre>
ADD( R1, R2, R3 )         Reg[ R3 ] = Reg[ R1 ] + Reg[ R2 ] = (-1) + 1 = 0
SUB( R2, R3, R4 )         Reg[ R4 ] = Reg[ R2 ] - Reg[ R3 ] = 1 - 0 = 1
CMPLT( R3, R4, R5 )       Reg[ R5 ] = (Reg[ R3 ] &lt; Reg[ R4 ]) = (0 &lt; 1) = 1
</pre>

so <b>Reg[ R5 ] = 1</b> for all three cases.

<p/>For the Buba (italics denote cases in which the Buba is different from
a working Beta, in which the most recently calculated result is not
being used):

<pre>
S1:
ADD( R1, R2, R3 )        Reg[ R3 ] = Reg[ R1 ] + Reg[ R2 ] = (-1) + 1 = 0
   <i>new value of Reg[R3] not available yet</i>
SUB( R2, R3, R4 )        Reg[ R4 ] = Reg[ R2 ] - Reg[ R3 ] = 1 - 5 = -4
   <i>new values of Reg[ R3 ] and Reg[ R4 ] not available yet</i>
CMPLT( R3, R4, R5 )      Reg[ R5 ] = (Reg[ R3 ] &lt; Reg[ R4 ]) = (5 &lt; -1) = 0
   <b>Reg[ R5 ] = 0</b>

S2:
ADD( R1, R2, R3 )        Reg[ R3 ] = Reg[ R1 ] + Reg[ R2 ] = (-1) + 1 = 0
NOP
   <i>new value of Reg[ R3 ] not available yet</i>
SUB( R2, R3, R4 )        Reg[ R4 ] = Reg[ R2 ] - Reg[ R3 ] = 1 - 5 = -4
NOP
   <i>new value of Reg[ R4 ] not available yet (but Reg[ R3 ] is available)</i>
CMPLT( R3, R4, R5 )      Reg[ R5 ] = (Reg[ R3 ] &lt; Reg[ R4 ]) = (0 &lt; -1) = 0
   <b>Reg[ R5 ] = 0</b>

S3:
ADD( R1, R2, R3 )        Reg[ R3 ] = Reg[ R1 ] + Reg[ R2 ] = (-1) + 1 = 0
NOP
   <i>new value of Reg[ R3 ] not available yet</i>
SUB( R2, R3, R4 )        Reg[ R4 ] = Reg[ R2 ] - Reg[ R3 ] = 1 - 5 = -4
   <i>new values of Reg[ R3 ] and Reg[ R4 ] not available yet</i>
CMPLT( R3, R4, R5 )       Reg[ R5 ] = (Reg[ R3 ] &lt; Reg[ R4 ]) = (5 &lt; -1) = 0
   <b>Reg[ R5 ] = 0</b>
</pre>

<q:subquestion>
Describe how to add minimal bypass logic to the Buba so that the
correct value will be left in R5 after the completion of sequence S2.

<q:answer>
For S2 to function correctly, we need to add bypass logic so that the
result of the ADD will be available for the SUB instruction. The ADD
is 2 instructions ahead of the SUB, so the ADD will be in the MEM
stage while the SUB is in the RF stage. So we need to add a bypass
path from the ALU output in the MEM stage which goes back to the B
operand in the RF stage. We also need the result of the SUB
instruction for the CMPLE, but this can be accomplished with the same
logic.

Describe what bypass paths are necessary to get the correct results in
all three cases.

<q:answer>
We have already discussed what is needed for S2. For S1:

<ul>
<li>Result of ADD needs to be passed to the following SUB instruction;
bypass required: from ALU output in ALU stage to B operand in RF stage</li>
<li>Result of SUB needs to be passed to the following CMPLT instruction;
bypass required: from ALU output in ALU stage to B operand in RF stage.</li>
<li>Result of ADD needs to be passed to the CMPLT instruction (2 cycles later);
bypass required: from ALU output in MEM stage to A operand in RF stage.</li>
</ul>

<p/>For S3:
<ul>
<li>Result of ADD needs to be passed to the SUB instruction, following two cycles later;
bypass required: from ALU output in MEM stage to B operand in RF stage</li>
<li>Result of SUB needs to be passed to the following CMPLT instruction;
bypass required: from ALU output in ALU stage to B operand in RF stage</li>
<li>Result of ADD needs to be passed to the CMPLT instruction, three cycles later;
bypass required: from ALU output in WB stage to A operand in RF stage.</li>
</ul>

<p/>In total, there are 4 bypass paths required:
<ul>
ALU output in ALU stage to B operand in RF stage<br/>
ALU output in MEM stage to A operand in RF stage<br/>
ALU output in MEM stage to B operand in RF stage<br/>
ALU output in WB stage to A operand in RF stage
</ul>

<p/>Note: we will also need muxes to select between the possible
operands for A and B

Add the minimal number of NOPs necessary to the following instructions
to make it produce identical results on the Buba and a normal Beta:

<pre>ADD(R3, R4, R5)
SUB(R5, R6, R7)
ADD(R1, R2, R3)
MUL(R7, R1, R2)
ADD(R4, R3, R5)
CMPLE(R7, R8, R9)
DIV(R7, R8, R10)
BEQ(R5, done)
ADDC(R1, 1, R5)
</pre>

<q:answer>
<pre>ADD( R3, R4, R5 )
NOP
NOP
NOP 			| Reg[R5] has not yet been updated
SUB( R5, R6, R7 )
ADD( R1, R2, R3 )
NOP
NOP 			| Reg[R7] has not yet been updated
MUL( R7, R1, R2 )
ADD( R4, R3, R5 )
CMPLE( R7, R8, R9 )
DIV( R7, R8, R10 )
NOP 			| Reg[R5] has not yet been updated
BEQ( R5, done )
NOP
ADDC( R1, 1, R5 )
</pre>

The NOP after the BEQ instruction is necessary so that ADDC will only
be executed if the branch is not taken.

This problem concerns the effect of external interrupts on the 5-stage
pipelined Beta with bypass paths and 1 branch delay slot with
annulment (i.e., the instruction in the delay slot is not executed).
Recall that if an external interrupt arrives in cycle I, then the
address of the interrupt handler, XAdr, is loaded into the PC at the
end of cycle I and that the instruction that occupied the IF stage
during cycle I gets replaced with BNE(R31,XAdr,XP).  Assume that these
are the first lines of the interrupt handler:

<pre>XAdr:   ADDC(SP,4,SP)
        ST(R0,-4,SP)
        ...
</pre>
		
First, consider this code fragment:

<pre>        . = 0x1234
start:  CMPLTC(R1,0,R2)
        SUB(R3,R2,R3)
        XOR(R0,R3,R0)
        MUL(R1,R2,R3)
        SHLC(R1,2,R4)
</pre>

<q:subquestion>
Complete the following pipeline diagram assuming that an interrupt
arrives in cycle t2.  What value is saved in XP as the result of the
interrupt?  Where should the interrupt handler return to when it
finishes?  Why doesn't it just return to the instruction whose address
is saved in XP?

<p/><img src="pipelinedbeta11.gif"/>

<q:answer>
<img src="pipelinedbeta14.gif"/>

<p/>The interrupt causes the address 0x123C to be stored in XP.  When
the interrupt handler is done it should return to the SUB instruction
at 0x1238.  If it would return to the address in the XP, then the SUB
instruction would never get executed, because it was not executed
before the interrupt handler.

</q:answer>

<q:subquestion>
Now consider what happens when we include a branch in the instruction
sequence:

<pre>skip:   BR(NEXT)
        CMPLTC(R1,0,R2)
        ADD(R3,R2,R3)
		
next:   XOR(R0,R3,R0)
        MUL(R1,R2,R3)
        SHLC(R1,2,R4)
</pre>

Complete the diagram for normal execution of the instructions starting
at skip.

Complete the diagram assuming that an interrupt arrives in cycle t2.
To what instruction will the handler return when it is finished?  Why
is this a problem?

<p/><img src="pipelinedbeta12.gif"/>

<q:answer>
<img src="pipelinedbeta16.gif"/>

<p/>After the interrupt handler is finished, it will return to the
CMPLTC instruction.  That clearly is not the correct behavior because
we want the branch to be taken and CMPLTC to be annulled.

<q:subquestion>
Normally interrupts are handled on the cycle on which they arrive,
i.e., the instruction in the IF stage is discarded and a branch is
forced to location Xadr.  Suppose the hardware could be changed so
that in some cases interrupts weren't handled on the cycle in which
they arrived.  In particular, suppose that interrupts were not allowed
to occur when annulling an instruction in a branch delay slot.
Explain how this solves the problem observed in part (D).

<q:answer>
By not allowing interrupts when annulling the branch delay slot (cycle
t2), then the value of PC+4 that gets stored in XP when the interrupt
is handled (cycle t3) is the address of the second instruction
following the branch, which in our example is the MUL instruction.
When returning from the interrupt handler, the XP will be adjusted to
the address of the XOR instruction.

</q:answer>
</q:subquestion>
<q:subquestion>
Suppose interrupts are not allowed to occur when annulling an
instruction in a branch delay slot.  Will the following program create
a loop that can't be interrupted?

<pre>
X:      BR(Y)
Y:      BR(X)
</pre>

<q:answer>
No, the sequence is interruptible.  If the interrupt arrives during
t2, and we have disabled interrupts during branch delay slot
annulment, then the interrupt will be serviced during t3.

<p/><img src="pipelinedbeta17.gif"/>

<p/>The address stored in XP is the instruction following the BR(X), so
when returning from the interrupt handler, then the XP is adjusted so
it has the address of the BR(X).  A similar argument could be made if
the interrupt arrives while annulling the branch delay slot of the
BR(X) instruction.
