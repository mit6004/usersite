    <div id="question1" class="question">
    <p/><hr/><p/><u>Problem 1.</u>
    
The following code outlines a simple timesharing scheduler:

<pre>struct MState {
  int Regs[31];                /* saved state of user's registers */
} User;

int N = 42;                    /* number of processes to schedule */
int Cur = 0;                   /* number of "active" process */

struct PCB {
  struct MState State;         /* processor state */
  Context PageMap;             /* VM map for process */
  int DPYNum;                  /* console/keyboard number */
} ProcTbl[N];                  /* one per process */

Scheduler() {
  ProcTbl[Cur].State = User;   /* save current user state */
  Cur = (Cur + 1)%N;           /* increment modulo N */
  User = ProcTbl[Cur].State;   /* make another process the current one */
}
</pre>

<p/>Suppose that each time the user hits a key on the keyboard, an interrupt
is generated and the interrupt handler copies the new character into a
kernel-resident input buffer.  The operating system includes a ReadKey service
call (SVC) which can be invoked by the user to read the next character from
the input buffer.  If the input buffer is empty,
the SVC should "hang" until a character is available.

<p/>The first draft of the ReadKey SVC handler is shown below.  The SVC handler
routine saves the user's state in the User structure and then call ReadKey_h().
When ReadKey_h() returns, the SVC handler restores the user's state and then
does a JMP(XP) to restart the user's program.

<pre>ReadKey_h() {
  int kdbnum = ProcTbl[Cur].DPYNum;
  while (BufferEmpty(kdbnum)) {
    /* busy wait loop */
  }
  User.Regs[0] = ReadInputBuffer(kdbnum);
}
</pre>


    <div id="question1A" class="question">

After executing a ReadKey SVC, where will the user program
find the next character from the input buffer?

Explain what's wrong with this proposed implementation.

    <div id="question1C" class="question">
    <ol type="A" start="3"><li>

A second draft of the keyboard handler is shown below:

<pre>ReadKey_h() {
  int kdbnum = ProcTbl[Cur].DPYNum;
  <b>if (BufferEmpty(kdbnum))
    User.Regs[XP] = User.Regs[XP] - 4;
  else</b>
    User.Regs[0] = ReadInputBuffer(kdbnum);
}
</pre>

Explain how the modifications fix the problems of the initial implementation.


</li></ol></div>

    <div id="question1D" class="question">
    <ol type="A" start="4"><li>
    
<img src="star.gif" alt="Discussed in section"/>
The designers notice that the process just wastes its time slice waiting for
someone to hit a key.  So they propose the following modifications:

<pre>ReadKey_h() {
  int kdbnum = ProcTbl[Cur].DPYNum;
  if (BufferEmpty(kdbnum)) {
    User.Regs[XP] = User.Regs[XP] - 4;
    <b>Scheduler();</b>
  } else
    User.Regs[0] = ReadInputBuffer(kdbnum);
}
</pre>

What would be the most likely effect of removing the line of
code where User.Regs[XP] is decremented by 4?


</li></ol></div>

    <div id="question1E" class="question">
    <ol type="A" start="5"><li>
    
<img src="star.gif" alt="Discussed in section"/>
Explain how this modification improves the overall performance of the
system (assume the decrement by 4 has not been removed).


</li></ol></div>

    <div id="question1F" class="question">
    <ol type="A" start="6"><li>
    
<img src="star.gif" alt="Discussed in section"/>
This version of the handler still doesn't prevent the process from
being scheduled each quantum, even though it may just call Scheduler()
once again if no character has appeared in the input buffer.  Explain
how the sleep(status) and wakeup(status) kernel routines described in
lecture can be used to make sure that processes are only scheduled when
there is something "useful" for them to do.

    <p/><hr/><p/><u>Problem 3.</u>
    
Real Virtuality, Inc markets three different computers, each with its
own operating system. The systems are:

<ul>
<b>Model A</b>: A timeshared,multi-user Beta system whose OS kernel is
uninterruptable.

<p/><b>Model B</b>: A timeshared Beta system which enables device
interrupts during handling of SVC traps.

<p/><b>Model C</b>: A single-process (not timeshared) system which
runs dedicated application code.
</ul>

<p/> Each system runs an operating system that supports concurrent I/O
on several devices, including an operator's console including a
keyboard. Les N. Dowd, RVI's newly-hired OS expert, is in a jam: he
has dropped the shoebox containing the master copies of OS source for
all three systems. Unfortunately, three disks containing handlers for
the ReadKey SVC trap, which reads and returns the ASCII code for the
next key struck on the keyboard, have gotten confused. Of course, they
are unlabeled, and Les isn't sure which handler goes into the OS for
which machine. The handler sources are

<pre>
ReadCh_h() {				/* VERSION R1 */
  if (BufferEmpty(0))			/* Has a key been typed? */
    User->Regs[XP] = User->Regs[XP]-4;	/* Nope, wait.	*/
  else 
    User->Regs[0] = ReadInputBuffer(0);	/* Yup, return it. */
}

ReadCh_h() {				/* VERSION R2 */
  int kbdnum=ProcTbl[Cur].DpyNum;	
  while (BufferEmpty(kbdnum)) ;		/* Wait for a key to be hit*/
  User->Regs[0] = ReadInputBuffer(kbdnum);  /*...then return it. */
}

ReadCh_h() {				/* VERSION R3 */
  int kbdnum=ProcTbl[Cur].DpyNum;	
  if (BufferEmpty(kbdnum)) {		/* Has a key been typed? */
    User->Regs[XP] = User->Regs[XP]-4;	/* Nope, wait. */
    Scheduler();
  } else 
    User->Regs[0] = ReadInputBuffer(kbdnum);	/* Yup, return it. /
}
</pre>


    <div id="question3A" class="question">
    <ol type="A" start="1"><li>
    
Show that you're cleverer than Les by figuring out which handler goes
with each OS, i.e., for each operating system (A, B and C) indicate
the proper handler (R1, R2 or R3).  Briefly explain your choices.


</li></ol></div>

    <div id="question3B" class="question">
    <ol type="A" start="2"><li>
    
But Les isn't that clever. In order to figure out which handler code
goes with each OS version, Les makes copies of each disk and
distributes them as "updates" to beta-test teams for each OS. Les
figures that if each handler version is tried by some beta tester in
each OS, the comments of the testers will allow him to determine the
proper OS for each handler.

<p/>Les sends out the alleged source code updates, routing each handler
source to testers for each OS. In response, he gets a barrage of
complaints from many of the testers. Of course, he's forgotten which
disk he sent to each tester. He asks your help to figure out which
combination of system and hander causes each of the complaints.  For
each complaint below, explain which handler and which OS the
complainer is trying to use.

<p/>Complaint: "I get linkage errors; Scheduler and ProcTbl are undefined!"

    <div id="question3C" class="question">

Complaint: "I can link up the system using the new handler, but the
system hangs when my application tries to read a key."

    <ol type="A" start="4"><li>
    
Complaint: "Hey, now the system always reads everybody's input from
keyboard 0. Besides that, it seems to waste a lot more CPU cycles than
it used to."

    <ol type="A" start="5"><li>
    
Complaint: "Neat, the new system seems to work fine. It even seems to
waste less CPU time than it used to!"
