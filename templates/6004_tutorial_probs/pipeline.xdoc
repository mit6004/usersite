<q:question>
Partial Products, Inc., has hired you as its vice president in charge
of marketing. Your immediate task is to determine the sale prices of
three newly announced multiplier modules. The top-of-the-line Cooker
is a pipelined multiplier. The Sizzler is a combinational
multiplier. The Grunter is a slower sequential multiplier. Their
performance figures are as follows (T is some constant time interval):

<pre>
        Throughput    Latency
Cooker    1/T            5T
Sizzler   1/4T           4T
Grunter   1/32T         32T
</pre>

Customers follow a single principle: Buy the cheapest combination of
hardware that meets my performance requirements.  These requirements
may be specified as a maximum allowable latency time, a minimum
acceptable throughput, or some combination of these. Customers are
willing to try any paralleled or pipelined configuration of
multipliers in an attempt to achieve the requisite performance. You
may neglect the cost (both financial and as a decrease in performance)
of any routing, latching, or other hardware needed to construct a
configuration.  Concentrate only on the inherent capabilities of the
arrangement of multipliers itself.

<p/>It has been decided that the Cooker will sell for $1000.  The
following questions deal with determining the selling prices of
Sizzlers and Grunters.

<q:subquestion>
<img src="star.gif" alt="Discussed in section"/>
How much can you charge for Sizzlers and still sell any? That is, is
there some price for Sizzlers above which any performance demands that
could be met by a Sizzler could also be met by some combination of
Cookers costing less?  If there is no such maximum price, indicate a
performance requirement that could be met by a Sizzler but not by any
combination of Cookers. If there is a maximum selling price, give the
price and explain your reasoning.

<q:answer>
If there is a performance requirement for the latency to be &lt;= 4T, then
there is no combination of Cookers that will meet this performance
requirement.  So it is in theory possible to sell some Sizzlers at any
price.  Using multiple Cookers can further improve the overall
multiplier throughput, but their latency cannot be shortened.

</q:answer>
</q:subquestion>
<q:subquestion>
<img src="star.gif" alt="Discussed in section"/>
How little can you charge for Sizzlers and still sell any Cookers? In
other words, is there a price for the Sizzler below which every
customer would prefer to buy Sizzlers rather than a Cooker? Give and
explain your answer, as above.

<q:answer>
The minimum price for a Sizzler is $250.01 if we want to continue
to sell Cookers. If the price of a Sizzler is less than that, 4
Sizzlers could be used in parallel to achieve the same throughput
as a Cooker with a better latency in the bargain.

</q:answer>
</q:subquestion>
<q:subquestion>
<img src="star.gif" alt="Discussed in section"/>
Is there a maximum price for the Grunter above which every customer
would prefer to buy Cookers instead?  As before, give the price, if it
exists, and explain your reasoning in either case.

<q:answer>
The maximum price for the Grunter is $999.99 since for applications
that can accept long latencies (&gt;= 32T) it's worth buying a Grunter if
it saves any money at all.

</q:answer>
</q:subquestion>
<q:subquestion>
<img src="star.gif" alt="Discussed in section"/>
Is there a minimum price for the Grunter below which every customer
would prefer to buy Grunters rather than a Cooker?  Once again, give
the price, if it exists, and explain your reasoning in either case.

<q:answer>
There is no minimum price for a Grunter that would cause every
customer to buy Grunters instead of Cookers.  The latency of the
Grunter will always be 32T, so when performance requirements demand
latencies &lt; 32T, Grunters won't do the job.

</q:answer>
</q:subquestion>
<q:subquestion>
Suppose that, as a customer, you have an application in which 64 pairs
of numbers appear all at once, and their 64 products must be generated
in as short a time as practicable. You have $1000 to spend.  At what
price would you consider using Sizzlers?  At what price would you
consider using Grunters?

<q:answer>
Sizzlers will be considered when they cost $250 or less.  Grunters may
be considered when they cost $124.93 or less.  To see this, consider
the case when Sizzlers cost $125.01.  Buying seven Sizzlers would
yield a latency of 40T at a cost of $875.07.  The customer cannot
afford another Sizzler, but adding a single Grunter for $124.93 will
reduce the latency to 36T.  All optimal configurations are explored
below:

<q:question>
Peculiar Peripherals, Inc. Builds a combinational encryption device
constructed of nine modules as follows:

<p/><img src="pipeline02.gif"/> 

<p/>The device takes an integer value X and computes an encrypted
version C(X).  In the diagram above each combinational component is
marked with its propagation delay in microseconds; contamination
delays are zero for each component.

<q:subquestion>

What is the latency and throughput of the combinational encryption
device?

<q:answer>
Latency = 5 + 3 + 1 + 5 + 3 + 3 + 5 = 25us.  Throughput = 1/25us.

</q:answer>
</q:subquestion>
<q:subquestion>
Redraw the diagram marking the locations for ideal (zero-delay)
registers that will pipeline the device for maximal throughput.
Ensure a register at the output and use the minimum number of
registers necessary.

<q:answer>
<img src="pipeline14.gif"/> 

<p/>We can remove some of the registers implied by contours (eg, those
shown with dotted lines) without decreasing the throughput.  There
are several equivalent variations of this diagram.

</q:answer>
</q:subquestion>
<q:subquestion>
Give the latency and throughput of your pipelined version.
Again assume ideal registers.

<q:answer>
There a six registers in each input-output path and the clock period
is 5, so latency = 30 and throughput = 1/5.

<q:question>
Consider the following combinational encryption device constructed
from six modules:

<p/><img src="pipeline01.gif"/> 

<p/>The device takes an integer value, X, and computes an encrypted
version C(X).  In the diagram above, each combinational component is
marked with its propagation delay in seconds; contamination delays are
zero for each component.

<p/>In answering the following questions assume that registers added to
the circuit introduce no additional delays (i.e., the registers have a
contamination and propagation delay of zero, as well as zero setup and
hold times).  Any modifications must result in a circuit that obeys
our rules for a well-formed pipeline and that computes the same
results as the combinational circuit above.  Remember that our
pipeline convention requires that every pipeline stage has a register
on its output.

<p/>When answering the questions below, if you add a register to one of
the arrows in the diagram, count it as a single register.  For
example, it takes two registers to pipeline both inputs to the
rightmost module (the one with latency 4).

<q:subquestion>
What is the latency of the combinational encryption device?

<q:answer>
Latency = delay along longest path from input to output = 2 + 3 + 4 = 9.

</q:answer>
</q:subquestion>
<q:subquestion>
If we want to increase the throughput of the encryption device,
what is the minimum number of registers we need to add?

<q:answer>
Three.  Playing by our pipelining rules, we always add a register
to the output.  The increase the throughput we need to add other
register that bisect the circuit.  The cheapest place to do this
is just before the "4" module, requiring two additional registers.

</q:answer>
</q:subquestion>
<q:subquestion>
If we are required to add exactly 5 registers, what is the best
throughput we can achieve?

<q:answer>
The best throughput we can achieve with 5 registers is 1/5: place
3 (!) registers on the output and two registers on the arcs leading
to the "4" module.  If we use 4 registers to divide the circuit between
the "2" and "3" modules, the resulting throughput is 1/7.

</q:answer>
</q:subquestion>
<q:subquestion>
If we can add as many registers as we like, is there an upper
bound on the throughput we can achieve?

<q:answer>
Yes: 1/4, because the best we can do by just adding registers is
to segregate the "4" module into its own pipeline stage.

</q:answer>
</q:subquestion>
<q:subquestion>
If we can add as many registers as we like, is there a lower
bound on the latency we can achieve?

<q:answer>
Lower bound on latency = 9.  We can never make the latency less by
adding pipeline registers; usually the latency increases.

<q:question>
Consider the following pipelined circuit: The number written on top of
each combinational element indicates its propagation delay in
nanoseconds. Assume that the pipeline registers shown are ideal (they
have a propagation delay, contamination delay, hold-time and a set-up
time of 0 ns).

<p/><img src="pipeline11.gif"/>

<q:subquestion>
What is the minimum clock period for which we can expect the given
circuit to operate correctly?

<q:answer>
8ns since we have to leave time for the logic between registers
A and C to do its stuff.

</q:answer>
</q:subquestion>
<q:subquestion>
What is the minimum latency of the circuit as shown?

<q:answer>
32ns = 4 pipeline stages at 8ns clock period.

</q:answer>
</q:subquestion>
<q:subquestion>
If the registers labeled F and G are removed, describe the
resulting circuit's behavior.

<q:answer>
Removing F and G combines the last two pipeline stages into a single
pipeline stage.  The latency improves to 24ns and the throughput
stays 1/8ns.

</q:answer>
</q:subquestion>
<q:subquestion>
Assume you were to redesign the pipelining of the given circuit
to achieve the maximum possible throughput with minimum latency. What
is the minimum number of pipeline registers required (including
register H)?

<q:answer>
We can do it with four registers if we allow ourselves to use
only a single register on values that go to multiple inputs:

</q:answer>
</q:subquestion>
<q:subquestion>
If the pipeline registers in the given circuit were all replaced
with non-ideal pipeline registers having propagation delays of 2 ns,
set-up times of 1 ns, and hold times of 0 ns, what would be the
maximum throughput achievable with the supplied six combinational
modules?

<q:answer>
The clock period would be set by the delay of the pipeline stage
containing the "8" module: tCLK = tPD,REG + 8 + tS,REG = 11ns.
So the throughput would be 1/11ns.

</q:answer>
</q:subquestion>
<q:subquestion>
If the pipeline registers in the given circuit were all
replaced with non-ideal pipeline registers having propagation delays
of 2 ns, set-up times of 1 ns, and hold times of 0 ns, how long before
the system clock must the input x be set-up to assure that the
pipeline registers A and B do not go into a metastable state?

<q:answer>
tS,X = 7 + tS,REG = 8ns.

Suppose that a second output, g(x), is desired from the given
circuit. It provides the partial result present at the output of the
pipeline register labeled C. If we wish the outputs f(x) and g(x) to
correspond to the same input after each clock, how many new pipeline
registers should be added to the circuit shown?

<q:answer>
We need to add 2 new registers:

<q:question>
You have the task of pipelining a combinational circuit consisting
entirely of 2-input NAND gates with 1ns propagation delay by adding
registers having tS=1ns, tH=1 ns, tPD=2 ns and tCD=1 ns.  The
propagation delay of the original combinational circuit is 20 ns.

<q:subquestion>
Assuming you add the minimum number of registers to pipeline the
circuit for maximal throughput, what is the latency of the resulting
pipelined circuit?

<q:answer>
If the combinational circuit has a tPD of 20ns when built from 1ns
components, there must be an input-output path involving 20 components.
To get maximal throughput, we'd place each component in its own
pipeline stage for a total of 20 stages.  Each stage requires
tPD,REG + tPD,NAND + tS,REG = 2 + 1 + 1 = 4ns to do its job.  So
the latency of the circuit pipelined for maximal throughput is 80ns.

Circuits Maximus, Inc. makes circuits which compute the maximum of two unsigned
binary numbers.  They are constructed using combinational 1-bit Maximizes modules
which are cascaded to deal with longer words, as shown below:

<p/><img src="pipeline08.gif"/>

<p/>This diagram show a 4-bit Maximizer chain which computes at the M outputs the
larger of the A or B input operands.  Each Maximizer module takes the Ith bit
of each of two binary operands, A and B, as well as comparison outputs from the
next higher-order Maximizer module in a chain, as shown below:

<p/><img src="pipeline09.gif"/>

<p/>A "1" on either of the inputs AGin and BGin from the next higher-order module
signals that A or B, respectively, is greater; both inputs are zero if the higher-order bits
are identical.  The M module computes the output values AGout and BGout from AGin, BGin,
Ai and Bi and sends these outputs values to the next lower-order M module.  It also
passes either Ai or Bi as the Mi output, denoting the Ith bit of the maximum of A
and B.

<p/>An implementation has been developed for the M module that has 10ns propagation
delay and a 2ns contamination delay.

To compute the maximum value of N inputs (N > 2), the following structure is
proposed:

<p/><img src="pipeline10.gif"/>

<p/>In this circuit, the maximum of four 4-bit unsigned numbers is
computed and appears at the output M3..M0.
What is the latency and throughput of this combinational circuit,
assuming that each M module has a propagation delay of 10ns?

<q:answer>
The longest path from inputs to outputs passes through 6 M
modules, so the latency is 60 and the throughput is 1/60.

Show how this circuit can be pipelined from maximum throughput
using a minimum number of pipeline stages.  Remember to include a
register at each output.

<q:answer>
The solution below uses a different technique for pipelining
a circuit.  Start by labeling each module with its maximum
"distance" from the inputs, i.e., the largest number of
components that have to be traversed on some path from the
inputs to the module in question.  Label all outputs with the
length (in modules) of the longest path from input to output
label each input with "0".  The number of pipeline
registers required on each wire is the difference between
the label at the start of the arrow and the end of the arrow.

<p/>A common mistake: forgetting to add the necessary pipeline
registers on the input and output arrows.

The following combinational circuit takes a single input
and produces a visual output by lighting the light on the center
component module.

<p/><img src="pipeline03.gif"/>

<p/>Consider the result of pipelining the above circuit for maximum
throughput, using the minimum number of registers necessary.  The
result would be a pipeline such that input asserted during clock
period I produces the proper output on the light during clock
period I+K (we want minimal K which gives maximal throughput).

How many registers should appear on the bold wire (marked X) in
the pipelined version of the above circuit?
