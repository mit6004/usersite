<q:question>
The behavior of a 1-input, 1-output device is measured by hooking a
voltage source to its input and measuring the voltage at the output
for several different input voltages:

<p/><center><img src="digital05.gif"/></center>

<p/>We're interested in whether this device can serve as a legal
combinational device that obeys the static discipline. For this
device, obeying the static discipline means that

<ul>
	if V<sub>IN</sub> &lt;= V<sub>IL</sub> then V<sub>OUT</sub> &gt;= V<sub>OH</sub>, and<br/>
	if V<sub>IN</sub> &gt;= V<sub>IH</sub> then V<sub>OUT</sub> &lt;= V<sub>OL</sub>.
</ul>

<p/>When answering the questions below, assume that all voltages are
constrained to be in the range 0V to 5V.

<q:subquestion>
<img src="star.gif" alt="Discussed in section"/>
Can one chose a V<sub>OL</sub> of 0V for this device?  Explain. 

<q:answer>
No, since the static discipline requires that V<sub>OUT</sub> &lt;= V<sub>OL</sub>
for a valid "0" output and V<sub>OUT</sub> for this device never falls
below 0.5V.

</q:answer>
</q:subquestion>
<q:subquestion>
<img src="star.gif" alt="Discussed in section"/>
What's the smallest V<sub>OL</sub> one can choose and still have the device obey
the static discipline?  Explain.

<q:answer>
The smallest V<sub>OL</sub> one can choose is 0.5V, the lowest output voltage
produced by the device.

</q:answer>
</q:subquestion>
<q:subquestion>
<img src="star.gif" alt="Discussed in section"/>
Assuming that we want to have 0.5V noise margins for both "0" and "1"
values, what are appropriate voltage levels for V<sub>OL</sub>,
V<sub>IL</sub>, V<sub>IH</sub>, and V<sub>OH</sub> so that the device
obeys the static discipline. Hint: there are many possible choices,
just choose one that obeys the constraints listed above.
	
<q:answer>
Here are the rules of operation imposed on us by the static discipline:

<ol>
<li>V<sub>IN</sub> &gt;= V<sub>IH</sub> implies V<sub>OUT</sub> &lt;= V<sub>OL</sub></li>
<li>V<sub>IN</sub> &lt;= V<sub>IL</sub> implies V<sub>OUT</sub> &gt;= V<sub>OH</sub></li>
<li>V<sub>OL</sub> + noise margin = V<sub>IL</sub></li>
<li>V<sub>OH</sub> - noise margin = V<sub>IH</sub></li>
</ol>

<p/>So if V<sub>OL</sub> = 0.5V and assuming 0.5V noise margins, then
<ul>
applying rule 3: V<sub>IL</sub> = 1V<br/>
applying rule 2 and looking at the VTC: V<sub>OH</sub> = 4V<br/>
applying rule 4: V<sub>IH</sub> = 3.5V
</ul>
and finally we can check that rule 1 is obeyed by these choices.

</q:answer>
</q:subquestion>
<q:subquestion>
Assuming that we want to have 0.5V noise margins for both "0" and "1"
values, what is the largest possible voltage level for V<sub>OL</sub> that still
results in a device that obeys the static discipline?

<q:answer>
To determine our maximum V<sub>OL</sub>, let's set it equal to N.  Then
<ul>
V<sub>IL</sub> = N + 0.5V
</ul>
which is simply the noise margin added to V<sub>OL</sub>.  If we let M be
the size of the forbidden region in volts,
<ul>
V<sub>IH</sub> = V<sub>IL</sub> + M = N + 0.5 + M.
</ul>
Finally,
<ul>
V<sub>OH</sub> = V<sub>IH</sub> + 0.5 = N + M + 1.
</ul>

<p/>We'll use the function VTC(v) as the name of the function
represented graphically by the voltage transfer characteristic.  So,
we want to find N and M such that V<sub>OH</sub> = VTC(V<sub>IL</sub>)
and V<sub>OL</sub> = VTC(V<sub>IH</sub>).
If we assume that V<sub>IL</sub> and V<sub>IH</sub> lie in the range [1,2.5] (we'll check
that assumption in a minute) then
<ul>
V<sub>OH</sub> = VTC(V<sub>IL</sub>) implies N + M + 1 = VTC(N + 0.5) = 6 -  2*(N + 0.5)<br/>
V<sub>OL</sub> = VTC(V<sub>IH</sub>) implies N = VTC(N + 0.5 + M) = 6 - 2*(N + M + 0.5)
</ul>

<p/>Solving the two equations we get N =1 and M = 1 giving us
V<sub>OL</sub> = 1, V<sub>IL</sub> = 1.5, V<sub>IH</sub> = 2.5, V<sub>OH</sub> = 3.
V<sub>IL</sub> and V<sub>IH</sub> lie in the range we assumed above, so we're all set.

</q:answer>
</q:subquestion>
<q:subquestion>
Assuming that we want to have equal noise margins for both "0" and "1"
values, what is the largest noise margin we can achieve with this
device and still obey the static discipline?

<q:answer>
It's clear that to maximize our noise margins, V<sub>OL</sub> should
be as small as possible and V<sub>OH</sub> should be as large as
possible.  By inspecting the VTC we see that V<sub>OL</sub> = 0.5V is
the best we can do.  From earlier parts we know we can achieve a noise
margin N of at least 0.5V.

<p/>We can use the following construction to figure out the largest
noise margin N.  Consider two of these devices hooked in series:

<p/><center><img src="digital06.gif"/></center>

<p/>The letters "A" through "E" mark points of interest where we'll
want to determine the voltage.  Assume we apply 0.5V at point "A".
Then:

<p/><ul>
at point "B", the largest voltage we'll measure is 0.5 + N, i.e.,
the voltage we applied to the other end of the wire and the worst-case
noise perturbation.

<p/>referring to the VTC, with 0.5+N on the input we'll measure a voltage
of 4 - 2(N + .5 - 1) = 5 - 2N at the output (point "C").

<p/>at point "D", the smallest voltage we'll measure is 5 - 3N, i.e.,
the voltage we applied to the other end of the wire and the worst-case
noise perturbation.

<p/>finally at point "E" we'd want to measure 0.5V, i.e., a valid "0"
voltage level.
</ul>

<p/>In order to get 0.5V at point "E", the VTC tells us that the input
voltage (voltage at "D") must be greater than or equal to 3V.  So
5 - 3N &gt;= 3 which we achieve if N &lt;= 2/3.

Inverter madness.

<q:subquestion>
<img src="star.gif" alt="Discussed in section"/>
The following graph plots the voltage transfer characteristic
for a device with one input and one output.

<p/><center><img src="digital07.gif"/></center>

Can this device be used as a combinational device in a logic
family with 0.75V noise margins?

<q:answer>
No.  The device doesn't have any region in which its gain is
greater than 1, so there are no choices for V<sub>IL</sub>,
V<sub>OL</sub>, V<sub>IH</sub>, V<sub>OH</sub> which provide
for non-zero noise margins.

</q:answer>
</q:subquestion>
<q:subquestion>
You are designing a new logic family and trying to decide on values
of the four parameters V<sub>IL</sub>, V<sub>OL</sub>, V<sub>IH</sub>,
V<sub>OH</sub> that lead to non-zero noise margins for various
possible inverter designs.  Four proposed inverter designs exhibit the
voltage transfer characteristics shown in the diagrams below.  For
each design, either (1) specify suitable values of V<sub>IL</sub>,
V<sub>OL</sub>, V<sub>IH</sub>, V<sub>OH</sub>. or (2) explain why no
values for these parameters satisfy the static discipline.

<p/><center><img src="digital08.gif"/></center>

<q:answer>
Device A: V<sub>OL</sub> = 1V, V<sub>IL</sub> = 3.5V, V<sub>IH</sub> = 5V, V<sub>OH</sub> = 6V
<p/>Device B: no values exist, the gain is never greater than one
<p/>Device C: no values exist, the gain is never greater than one
<p/>Device D: V<sub>OL</sub> = .5V, V<sub>IL</sub> = 1V, V<sub>IH</sub> = 3.5V, V<sub>OH</sub> = 6V

Static discipline.

<q:subquestion>
<img src="star.gif" alt="Discussed in section"/>
Consider a combinational <i>buffer</i> with one input and one output.
Suppose we set its input to some voltage (V<sub>IN</sub>), wait for
the device to reach a steady state, then measure the voltage on its
output (V<sub>OUT</sub>) and find V<SUB>OUT</SUB> &lt; V<sub>OL</sub>.
What can we say about V<sub>IN</sub>?

<q:answer>
A combinational device guarantees that valid inputs lead to valid outputs
if we wait longer than the propagation delay.  But the opposite inference
isn't true: a valid output doesn't imply a valid input -- for example,
the buffer is allowed a valid "1" before the input has crossed V<sub>IH</sub>.

<p/>So the only statement that we can make is that V<sub>IN</sub> &lt; V<sub>IH</sub>
since if V<sub>IN</sub> &gt;= V<sub>IH</sub> the buffer is required
to produce V<sub>OUT</sub> &gt;= V<sub>OH</sub>.


</q:answer>
</q:subquestion>
<q:subquestion>
Now consider an inverter.  Suppose we set its inputs to some voltage
(V<sub>IN</sub>), wait for the device to reach a steady state, then
measure the voltage on its output (V<sub>OUT</sub>) and find
V<sub>OUT</sub> &gt; V<sub>OH</sub>.  What can we say about
V<sub>IN</sub>?

<q:answer>
Using the same argument as above, the only statement we can make
is that V<sub>IN</sub> &lt; V<sub>IH</sub>.

Ternary Logic.

<p/>Ternary is a term referring to the number system in base 3.
Consider a convention in which a ternary digit is presented as an
electric voltage between 0 and 10 V.  Let 0-1 V represent a valid "0"
output, 4-6 V a valid "1" output and 9-10 V a valid "2" output.

<img src="star.gif" alt="Discussed in section"/>
Assuming noise margins 1 V wide, show the mapping of logic levels to
voltages for this ternary system.  Include valid logic-level outputs,

Graph the transfer characteristic for a device capable of acting as a
ternary logic buffer, i.e., a device that produces at its output the
same logic level present at its input, as shown below:

<p/><center><img src="digital14.gif"/></center>

<q:answer>
We need three stable regions, one for each valid output, and a high
gain between valid levels to help restore poor inputs to an output
valid level.

<q:subquestion>
Can a device with the following transfer characteristic be used as
a ternary logic buffer?  Why or why not?

<q:answer>
No, it can't be used as a ternary logic buffer. The device has only
two stable regions.

How many bits of information are carried in a ternary signal on a single wire?

<q:answer>
log<sub>2</sub>(3) = 1.585 bits

</q:subquestion>
<q:subquestion>
How many different combinations of valid logic levels can be encoded
on three ternary wires?  How many bits of information does this
represent?  How many wires would be needed to carry this same amount
of information in binary?

<q:answer>
27 different combinations can be encoded. This corresponds to
log<sub>2</sub>(27) = 4.75 bits of information. Each binary wire
carries one bit, so we would need 5 wires.

</q:subquestion>
<q:subquestion>
What is the information flow in bits/second for three ternary wires if
a new set of values is sent every 10 ms?  What is the information flow
in bits/second for three binary wires if a new set of values is sent
every 10 ms?

<q:answer>
Trinary: 4.75bits/packet * 1 packet/10ms = 475 bits/second<br/>
Binary: 3 bits/packet * 1 packet/10ms = 300 bits/second

<q:question>
<i>Barracks logic</i> is built out of sleeping soldiers covered by
electric blankets. Each blanket has a control switch with discrete
control settings ranging in 5-degree (Fahrenheit) intervals from 0 to 50
degrees. The temperature of a soldier covered by one or more electric blankets
will be the sum of the ambient temperature in the barracks
plus the setting on the controller for each blanket.

<p/>Each soldier has a preferred sleeping temperature, which varies from
individual to individual but is always within the range of 60 to 80
degrees, inclusive. If a soldier's temperature departs from
her preferred temperature, the soldier will wake up once
every minute and adjust the control by one 5-degree increment in the
appropriate direction (if the solider is cold, the solider will
increase the setting on the control, and vice versa).  The soldier will
continue these adjustments by 5-degree increments until she once again reaches
her preferred temperature (and goes to sleep) or runs out of settings (in
which case she grumbles angrily in bed).

<p/>If soldiers are allowed to control their own blankets, each will
soon reach their preferred temperature and slide into nocturnal bliss
(assuming a suitable ambient temperature).  The interesting aspects
of barracks logic result from switching the controls of the various
blankets to different soldiers.  Inputs to the system are
accomplished by placing a few controls in the hands of outsiders, and
outputs are read from the control settings of certain soldiers
designated by the logic designer.

<q:subquestion>
Draw the graph of output control setting vs. input control
setting for a typical soldier in steady state.  Assume an ambient
temperature of 40 degrees.  Suggest good choices of the
valid regions for the two logical values, the forbidden zone, and the
noise margins.  Let logical 0 be when a control is completely off
and logical 1 be when the control is completely on (or at the highest
setting).

<q:answer>
The soldiers have infinite gain since they continue to adjust their
blanket as long as their temperature differs even slightly from
their preferred temperature.  (Actually given the control works only
in 5-degree increments, it's unlikely than any solider will sleep
unless the difference between the ambient temperature and her preferred
temperature is exactly 5 degrees.)  So the typical soldier's graph
looks like:

<p/><center><img src="digital18.gif"/></center>

<p/>where the vertical part of the curve for a particular soldier
would be located anywhere between 60 and 80 degrees.

<p/>Examining the curve we see that it's possible to achieve a
20-degree noise margin for low values and a 10-degree noise margin
at high values:

<ul>
T<sub>OL</sub> = 0 degrees<br/>
T<sub>IL</sub> = 20 degrees<br/>
T<sub>IH</sub> = 40 degrees<br/>
T<sub>OH</sub> = 50 degrees
</ul>

</q:answer>
</q:subquestion>
<q:subquestion>
List some sources of noise that justify the need for noise margins.

<q:answer>
Noise appears as a difference in temperature between the setting of
the input control and what the solider actually feels.  Sources
of noise: changes in ambient temperature caused by drafts, changes
in blanket operature due to line voltage variations, etc.

Even though it is the middle of February, a sudden warm spell raises
the ambient temperature in our barracks logic system to 55 degrees.
Sketch a new graph of output control setting vs. input control setting
in the warmer barracks.

<q:answer>
Since the solider works the same, the whole graph shifts to the left
since the input settings would be lower to achieve the same
temperature at the soldier:

</q:answer>
</q:subquestion>
<q:subquestion>
Over what range of ambient temperatures will barracks logic function
reliably?

<q:answer>
"Reliable" in this example means that all soldiers can produce both
outputs (i.e., output control set to 0 and 50).  Let N be the desired
noise margin in degrees.  If the temperature rises above 60-N degrees,
soldiers with a preferred temperature of 60 will always have
their output control set to 0 regardless of the setting of their
input control.  Similarly if the temperature falls below 30+N degrees
soldiers with a preferred temperature of 80 will always have
their output control set to 50 regardless of the setting of their
input control.

<q:subquestion>
To create a system with multiple inputs, we allow several blankets to be
placed over a single soldier.  What is the maximum fanin possible in
barracks logic if 170 degrees is the highest temperature a soldier
can tolerate without his characteristics being permanently altered?

<q:answer>
If each soldier can tolerate 170 degrees then 170-ambient is the
number of degrees that can be added to a soldier's environment
by blankets.  Each blanket can add up to 50 degrees, so
(170-ambient)/50 is the limit on the number of blankets that can
be piled on one soldier.

<q:question>
Bread and Circuits, Inc. has discovered an interesting electronic
device (a Z-module) which is made using a single yeast cell, a speck
of flour, and a grain of salt.  The Z-module has two inputs carrying
voltages VA and VB and a single output carrying VC.  The output VC
settles, after a 10ns period of stable input voltages, to the product
of the input voltages restricted to range of 0V to 2V.  In other
words,

<p/><table cellpadding="4">
<tr>
  <td valign="center" rowspan="2">V<sub>C</sub> =</td>
  <td>V<sub>A</sub> * V<sub>B</sub> when 0 &lt;= V<sub>A</sub> * V<sub>B</sub> &lt;= 2</td>
</tr><tr>
  <td>2 when V<sub>A</sub> * V<sub>B</sub> &gt; 2</td>
</tr></table>

<p/>Assume that the Z-module treats negative input voltages as if they were 0.

<p/>B&amp;C is trying to make a logic family using Z-modules.  As a
starting point, they claim that

<p/><center><img src="digital11.gif"/></center> 

<p/>constitutes a valid combinational buffer under the proper
voltage-to-logic representation conventions and will yield reasonable
noise margins.

<q:subquestion>
Which, if any, of the following proposed voltage thresholds yields a
valid buffer with positive noise margins?

<pre>
A. VOL = 1.5V  VIL = 1.6V  VIH = 1.7V  VOH = 1.8V
B. VOL = 0.7V  VIL = 0.9V  VIH = 1.1V  VOH = 1.3V
C. VOL = 0.1V  VIL = 0.3V  VIH = 1.7V  VOH = 1.9V
D. VOL = 0.5V  VIL = 0.5V  VIH = 1.5V  VOH = 1.5V
</pre>

<q:answer>
Choice A would allow two "low" inputs (e.g., 1.6V) to generate a "high" output
(1.6 * 1.6 = 2.56 which is above VOH) => not okay.

<p/>Choice B would allow two "high" inputs (e.g., 1.1V) to generate an underdetermined
output (1.1 * 1.1 = 1.21 which is above VOL but below VOH)
 => not okay.

<p/>Choice C has positive noise margins and the allowed input voltages
result in the desired behavior => okay

<p/>Choice D doesn't have positive noise margins => not okay.

</q:answer>
</q:subquestion>
<q:subquestion>
Determine the voltage thresholds that maximize the noise margins of
B&amp;C's buffer.  If the noise margins are not independent, maximize the
smaller of the two.

<q:answer>
To maximize the noise margins of the buffer, we consider the voltage
transfer characteristic of the Z-module. Since VIN<sup>2</sup> &gt;= 2 will result in
a VOH of 2, then we have VIH &gt;= sqrt(2).  Thus, VIH = sqrt(2), and VOH = 2.

<p/>Since VOUT = VIN<sup>2</sup> in the lower region of the voltage transfer
characteristic, then let us represent VIN with "x" and VOUT with "x<sup>2</sup>".
Then the lower noise margin is represented by the function
f(x)&nbsp;=&nbsp;x&nbsp;-&nbsp;x<sup>2</sup>.

<p/>To maximize the noise margin, we take the first derivative of f(x)
and set it to zero: f'(x)&nbsp;=&nbsp;1&nbsp;-&nbsp;2x&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.
Solving for x gives 0.5. Thus, VIL = x = 0.5V, and VOL = x<sup>2</sup> = 0.25V.

</q:answer>
</q:subquestion>
<q:subquestion>
Ivan Idea, chief logician at B&amp;C, is exploring the use of a single
Z-module as a two-input logic gate, again with positive noise margins.
He suspects that a Z-module, under the appropriate logic conventions,
can be used for an AND or OR gate which obeys the static discipline.
Ivan's been at it for several weeks and needs your help.

<p/>Can you find a way to use a Z-module for an AND or OR combinational
device?  If so, give the appropriate input and output voltage
thresholds and the function performed.  If not, carefully explain why
the Z-module can't be used as AND or OR.

<q:answer>
No, the Z-module can't be used as either an AND gate or an OR gate.

<p/>In order to implement an OR gate, we must have the behavior that a
logic "1" input and a logic "0" input produces a logic "1" output.  In
the case of a single Z-module, if we had 2V as the first input and 0V
as the second input (noiseless, perfect input voltages) the output is
0V, instead of a logic "1" voltage.

<p/>In order to implement an AND gate, we must have the behavior that a
logic "1" input and a logic "0" input produces a logic "0" output.
According to the static discipline, a "0" output means VOUT should be
less than equal to VOL.  If we
substitute 2V for the logic "1" input and consider the "0"
input, we have VOUT = VIL * 2 &lt;= VOL.  But we can't have VOL &gt;
VIL, so the Z-module can't function as an AND gate.

</q:answer>
</q:subquestion>
<q:subquestion>
Ivan sidesteps the previous enigma by allowing himself the use of
several Z-modules as components of a single logic gate.  He assumes
(and you may too) that noise enters the system only between logic
gates, not between the components of a single gate.  He notes that
each of B&amp;C's proposed buffers (using one Z-module) is an amplifier
with gain greater than one.  Ivan reasons that by cascading many such
devices (as shown below), he can achieve arbitrarily high gain and
hence excellent noise margins.

<p/><center><img src="digital12.gif"/></center> 
 
<p/>His plan is to use such a high-gain cascade on the output of a
Z-module to restore the validity of marginal signal levels.  Describe
the voltage transfer characteristic (i.e, VIN vs. VOUT) of a cascade
of a large number of Z-modules (via an expression or sketch).

<q:answer>
For N cascaded Z-modules, the voltage transfer characteristic is:

<p/><center><img src="digital20.gif"/></center> 

</q:answer>
</q:subquestion>
<q:subquestion>
Is there any way by which many Z-modules can be used to build a
2-input AND gate whose noise margins are both greater than 0.75V?  If
so, sketch an approach (giving a diagram and calculating the noise
margins).  If not, give a brief but convincing explanation.

<q:answer>
It is possible to build an AND gate whose noise margins greater than
0.75V.  Our strategy is to clean up both input signals independently
before computing the logic function.  A cascade of 5 Z-modules is
enough to restore marginal signals, and the last Z-module on the right
performs the AND function.  The diagram looks like this:

<q:question>
<b>Combinational construction rules</b>

<p/>In lecture, we learned two basic principles regarding the class of
combinational devices.  The first allows us to build a combinational
device from, e.g., electronic components:

<ul>
<li>A <i>combinational device</i> is a circuit element that has
<ul>
<li>one or more digital <i>inputs</i></li>
<li>one or more digital <i>outputs</i></li>
<li>a <i>functional specification</i> that details the value of each
output for every possible combination of valid input values</li>
<li>a <i>timing specification</i> consisting (at minimum) of an upper
bound t<sub>pd</sub> on the required time for the device to compute
the specified output values from an arbitrary set of stable, valid
input values.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p/>while the second allows us to construct complex combinational
devices from acyclic circuits containing simpler ones:

<ul>
<li>A set of interconnected elements is a combinational device if
<ul>
<li>each circuit element is combinational</li>
<li>every input is connected to exactly one output or to some vast
supply of 0's and 1's</li>
<li>the circuit contains no directed cycles</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p/>In this problem, we ask you to think carefully about why these rules
work - in particular, why an acyclic circuit of combinational devices,
constructed according to the second principle, is itself a
combinational device as defined by the first.  You may assume for the
following that every input and output is a logical 0 or 1.

<p/>Consider the following 2-input acyclic circuit whose two
components, A and B, are each combinational devices:

<p/><center><img src="digital01.gif"/></center>

<p/>The propagation delay - the upper bound on the output settling time
- for each device is specified in nanoseconds.  The functional
specifications for each component are given as truth tables detailing
output values for each combination of inputs:

<p/><center><img src="digital02.gif"/></center>

<q:subquestion>
Give a truth table for the acyclic circuit, i.e. a table that
specifies the value of z for each of the possible combinations of
input values on x and y.

</q:answer>
</q:subquestion>
<q:subquestion>
Describe a general procedure by which a truth table can be computed
for each output of an arbitrary acyclic circuit containing only
combinational components.  [HINT: construct a functional specification to
each circuit node].

<q:answer>
Since each circuit node is connected to an output of some
combinational element, the functional specification for each circuit
node is given by the functional specification for the combinational
element which drives it.  If we start with components that are only
connected to inputs to the overall circuit, we can build truth tables
for their outputs that only involve those inputs.  We can then work on
the next tier of components and build truth tables for their outputs
that only involve overall circuit inputs.  Continuing in this manner,
we'll eventually reach components that drive the overall circuit
outputs and be able to construct truth tables for each output that
only involves overall circuit inputs.

<p/>In our example, we'd first build a truth table for the output of the
A module and then use that table to build a table for Z:

computed for an arbitrary acyclic circuit containing only
combinational components.  [HINT: add a timing specification to each
circuit node].

<q:answer>
<ol>
<li>Label each INPUT to the circuit with tpd=0.
<li>Repeatedly</li>
<ul>
<li>Find a circuit element E whose input nodes are each labeled
with a prop delay but whose output nodes are not.</li>
<li>Label each output node of E with the delay M, where M is the
prop delay of E plus the MAXIMUM of the times on the input nodes.</li>
<li>When you can't find an unlabeled output node, stop.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The prop delay spec for the device is the MAX of the prop delay
labels on the output nodes.</li>
</ol>

<q:subquestion>
Do your general procedures for computing functional specifications and
propagation delays work if the restriction to acyclic circuits is
relaxed?  Explain.

<q:answer>
No.  Without cycles, you're guaranteed to be able to find a new output
node to label (i.e., the output of some element E whose inputs are
already labeled) until the entire circuit is labeled.  If you have
cycles, the algorithm breaks down.  You can be left with a cycle of
elements whose outputs are unlabeled and some of whose inputs are
unlabeled.

<q:question>
If you are given the following 2-input and 2-output combinational
block:

<p/><center><img src="digital10.gif"/></center>

<p/>with the following functional description: The output X is the the
logical complement of the input A, and the output Y is the the logical
complement of the input B. And valid ouputs are guaranteed after
valid inputs have been established for 1 second.

<q:subquestion>
Does this device adhere to the static disipline?

<q:answer>
Yes: there's an unambiguous functional specification for each output
and a maximum propagation delay has been specified.

</q:answer>
</q:subquestion>
<q:subquestion>
Suppose that the output X is connected to the input B, what
output would you expect?

<q:answer>
If you assume that the circuit was composed of two inverters
(one with A as its input, the other with B as its input) then
we would expect Y = A after 2 second propagation delay.

<p/>However, there are other implementations that have the
same functional specification.  In particular, X might be
implemented with logic that uses both A and B as inputs.
In this case, connecting X to B would create a cycle and
the value of Y might be undetermined.

</q:answer>
</q:subquestion>
<q:subquestion>
Suppose the functional description was changed to the
following: The ouput X is a 1 if both A and B are "0", and
Y is a 1 if either A or B but not both are "1".
Does this change the answer the previous question?

<q:answer>
No.  Since X and Y are functions of both A and B, it's
more obvious that a cycle would be created when X was connected
to B.
