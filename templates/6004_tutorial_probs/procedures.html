<img src="star.gif" alt="Discussed in section"/> 
Consider the following implementation of an algorithm for
finding the greatest common divisor of two integers:

<pre>int gcd(int a,int b) {
  if (a == b) return a;
  if (a &gt; b) return gcd(a-b,b);
  return gcd(a,b-a);
}
</pre>

<p/>The C compiler has compiled this procedure into the following code
for an unpipelined Beta processor:

<pre>gcd:
        PUSH (LP)
        PUSH (BP)
        MOVE (SP, BP)
        PUSH (R1)
        PUSH (R2)
        LD (BP, -12, R0)
        LD (BP, -16, R1)
        CMPEQ (R0, R1, R2)
        BT (R2, L1)
        CMPLE (R0, R1, R2)
        BT (R2, L2)
        PUSH (R1)
        SUB (R0, R1, R2)
        PUSH (R2)
        BR (gcd, LP)
        DEALLOCATE (2)
        BR (L1)
L2:
        SUB (R1, R0, R2)
        PUSH (R2)
        PUSH (R0)
        BR (gcd, LP)
        DEALLOCATE (2)
L1:
        POP (R2)
        POP (R1)
        MOVE (BP, SP)
        POP (BP)
        POP (LP)
        JMP (LP)
</pre>

BR(L1) is encoded as 0x77FF0007.  Remember that PUSH is

Looking at the code, a student suggests that both DEALLOCATE
instructions could be eliminated since deallocation is performed
implicitly by the MOVE(BP,SP) instruction in the exit sequence.  After
calling gcd, would it be possible to tell if the DEALLOCATE
instructions had been removed?

Yes, it would be possible to tell: even though the stack is
reset correctly by the MOVE(BP,SP) instruction, that happens after
the POP(R1) and POP(R2) instructions, so they will not restore the
values of R1 and R2 from the values pushed onto the stack during
the entry sequence.

gcd(24,16) =&gt; gcd(8,16) =&gt; gcd(8,8), at which point no more

All calls in the execution of gcd(28,70) have a &lt; b, so all the recursive

Assume the function gcd is called with two positive non-zero arguments
while the stack pointer set to 0x8000 (i.e. it's two arguments are
placed in 0x8000, and 0x8004). Sometime thereafter, the Beta is
stopped and the contents of various memory locations and registers are
examined. Here is a summary of what is seen:

<p/><img src="procedures01.gif"/>

<p/>The contents of the blank table entries are unknown.


    <div id="question3A" class="question">

Fill in as many blank spaces as possible in the table above and

The table below shows what we can deduce about the contents
of the stack from what we have been given.  Here are some notes on how
we did this:

<ul>

<li>By looking at the code, we can tell that each stack frame would be
6 words long.  Tracing the frames from the beginning, we can mark out
the stack frames and thus know what purpose each memory location
serves (e.g., holding LP, etc.)</li>

<p/><li> Since all but the first stack frame belongs to a recursive
call from gcd to itself, and since there is only one place in gcd
where it calls itself, we know that, except in the first frame, the
saved LP should have the same value in all the frames: 0x80000068.
Similarly, knowing the stack frame structure allows us to know where
BP will be pointing in each stack frame.  This lets us know the value
of BP that will be saved in the next stack frame.  This way we can
determine the BP values saved in all the frames except the first.</li>

<p/><li>To determine the arguments, we need to work backwards.  First,
we note that the values of R1 and R2 when the program was stopped tell
us the arguments x and y, respectively, of the current invocation of
gcd.  This is because the previous invocation used R1 and R2 for
pushing the arguments to the recursive call.  Thus, we know 0x8060
contains y=3, and 0x8064 contains x=6. We further know that the
arguments to the previous invocation were y=9 and x=6 because the fact
that R0 was 0 when we stopped the program tells us that in the
previous invocation, y was greater than x and that the new y (i.e., 3)
was the difference between the old y (i.e., 9) and the old x (i.e.,
6).</li>

<p/><li> Unfortunately, knowing that the third invocation to gcd was
gcd(x=6,y=9) does not tell us for sure what the arguments to the
invocation before that one were.  They could have been (6,15) or
(15,9).  Fortunately, it is not too hard to draw a binary tree of the
possible arguments for each call to gcd.  If we do this, we will find
that of the 8 possible argument pairs for the top-level call to gcd,
only (x=24,y=33) has 24 as its first argument.</li>

<p/><li>Finally, after filling-in the arguments, we can trace through
the code and determine the values in the R1 and R2 slots.  We can do
this more quickly by noticing the relation between the pushed R1 and
R2 values and the arguments before them.  Note however, that this
pattern is not a general rule, but just occurs because gcd uses R1 and
R2 when PUSHing arguments.</li>

<p/><li>We cannot know the values in memory locations 0x800C to 0x8014
because we don't know exactly what main (gcd's original caller) was
doing with BP, R1 and R2 before it called gcd.  For example, main does
not have to use R1 and R2 to PUSH the arguments, so we cannot
determine R1 and R2 as we did for the recursive calls.</li>

We know from the state of the machine when it was stopped that in a
recursive call, LP is set to 0x80000068 by the BR(gcd,LP) instruction
inside gcd.  This gives us the address of the DEALLOCATE(2)
instruction following the BR.  From here, we count 25 instructions
backwards to gcd, keeping in mind that PUSH and POP are macros
composed of 2 instructions each.  Thus, we know that the address of
gcd must be 25*4 = 100 = 0x64 bytes before 0x80000068, that is,
0x80000004.  (Actually, the real address of gcd is 0x04.  The 8 in the

If we let the program continue to run, it would make one more
recursive call to gcd(3,3), which will then return a 3.  This means we
would add 2 more words to the stack to complete the stack frame of
gcd(6,3) and add another 6 words for the frame of gcd(3,3).  Thus, the
greatest value that the stack pointer register (SP) will take on would
be 0x8090.

As a worst-case upper bound, note that the worst case happens when
either x or y is 1.  In this case, we recurse as many times as the
non-1 number, or in other words, the number of levels is max(x,y).
This is not a tight bound, however.  A tighter upper bound would be
max(x,y)/gcd(x,y).  This is because the number of calls is equal to
the number of subtractions it takes to get from the larger number to
gcd(x,y), where each subtraction is at least as large as gcd(x,y).
This is not the tightest upper bound possible yet, however.  For
example, in this specific case, it gives us 33/3 = 11 levels instead
of the actual 6.  In any case, the maximum stack depth would be (# of
levels)*24 bytes, since each stack frame has 6 words * 4 bytes/word =
24 bytes.

Object-oriented languages often require

    <div id="question7" class="question">
    <p/><hr/><p/><u>Problem 7.</u>
    
In this problem, we take a quick look at one of several alternatives
to the instruction set architecture family represented by the Beta.
We consider here the design of a pure stack machine, an architectural
approach which has been used frequently in virtual machines (e.g.,
abstract machine architectures used to communicate instruction
sequences to compilers) and occasionally in real machines such as the
Burroughs B6700.

The idea of a pure stack machine is to use the processor's stack as
the only programmer-visible processor state.  Unlike the Beta, there
are no registers for explicit use by instructions: nearly all
instructions pop their source operands from the stack, and push their
result onto the stack.  Although the implementation of a stack machine
may use dedicated registers (such as an SP and PC), such registers are
never explicitly addressed by code. As a result, most instructions are
coded simply as an opcode - they need no fields to specify source and
destination operands.  In our hypothetical stack machine, such
instructions consist of a single byte.

LOAD and STORE instructions are exceptions, and provide a way to
access data from memory.  Each is represented as an opcode followed by
a 4-byte memory address; LOAD pushes the contents of the indicated
address onto the stack, while STORE pops the top word from the stack
and stores it into the supplied address.  On such a machine, the
program

<pre>	LOAD(A)
	NEG
	LOAD(B)
	MUL
	LOAD(C)
	DIV
	STORE(D)

	

A:	LONG(123456)
B:	LONG(456789)
C:	LONG(234567)
D:	LONG(0)
</pre>

<p/>would compute -A*B/C and store the result in D.  Note that the
single-byte instruction NEG pops and negates its argument, pushing the
result back onto the stack; DIV and MUL each pop two operands and push
the result back onto the stack. Note that variables and constants are
stored at arbitrary locations in main memory.


    <div id="question7A" class="question">
    <ol type="A" start="1"><li>

        </a></div> <div id="answer7A" class="answer" style="display:none"><font color="blue">
Excluding the four data locations, we are interested in the amount of
bytes taken from the LOAD(A) to the STORE(D).  There are 7
instructions, and each instruction takes 1 byte, except for LD's and
ST's which take an additional 4 bytes to index the address.
Therefore, this takes 23 bytes.

Since each instruction is 4 bytes long, and we have 16 instructions
(and embedded data), this takes up 64 bytes.  This is over twice as
many bytes as the stack machine code.

    <div id="question7C" class="question">

Now rewrite your Beta code assuming that A, B, C, and D are stored in
the local stack frame as local variables, i.e., they are addressed
using BP with the appropriate offset.  How many bytes does your new
code require?

<div id="control7C" class="control" style="padding-top: 8px; padding-bottom: 8px">
        <a href="#" onClick="toggle('7C'); return false">

        </a></div> <div id="answer7C" class="answer" style="display:none"><font color="blue">

If A, B, C, and D are in the stack, we can use R27, the BP register,
to retrieve A, B, and C:

<pre>    LD(BP, 0, R0)    | Load memory location value "A" in R0
    LD(BP, 4, R1)    | Load memory location value "B" in R1
    LD(BP, 8, R2)    | Load memory location value "C" in R2
    MULC(R0, -1, R0) | Perform the -A operation
    MUL(R0, R1, R1)  | Perform the -A*B operation.
    DIV(R1, R2, R2)  | Perform the -A*B/C operation
    ST(R2, 12, BP)   | Store computation in memory location D
</pre>

Now, the code is only 7 lines long, of 4 bytes/instruction =&gt; 28 bytes.
This is still more than the stack implementation, but less than part
B.

Stack machines commonly provide special load and store instructions
optimized for access to data (such as local variables) stored near the
top of the stack.  Typically such instructions address memory
locations computed using an instruction-stream constant and the
current value of the SP.

<p/>Propose specific SP-relative instructions, LOAD-SR and STORE-SR,
that allow access to locations stored near the top of the stack.
Specify how each instruction is coded, including an opcode and any
instruction-stream constant necessary.  Describe the details of each
instruction's operation in the same way instructions are documented in
the Beta Documentation

<pre>LOAD-SR
Usage: LOAD-SR(literal), where literal is a one byte unsigned offset.
PC = PC + 4
EA = Reg[SP] - 4*literal
MEM[SP] = Mem[EA]

</pre>

The effective address EA is computed by subtracting from the stack
pointer four times the 8-bit displacement literal. The location in
memory specified by EA is read and then pushed onto the stack. We use
an unsigned format because we don't need to represent both positive
and negative offsets.

<pre>STORE-SR
Usage: STORE-SR(literal), where literal is a one byte unsigned offset.
PC = PC + 4
EA = Reg[SP] - 4*literal
MEM[EA] = MEM[SP-4]
Reg[SP] = Reg[SP] - 4
</pre>

The effective address EA is computed by subtracting from the stack
pointer four times the 8-bit displacement literal. The top element of
the stack is popped off and written into the effective address.

Recode the above sequence for a stack machine, assuming that A, B, C,

taken?

 New code assuming that a, b, c and d have been pushed onto the stack, in that order.

<pre>
    LOAD-SR(4) 	| push a onto the top of the stack. (note, this changes how 
                 | far away b,c, and d are!)
    NEG

    MUL
    LOAD-SR(3)   | bring c to the top of the stack
    DIV
    STORE-SR(2)  | write d back to its original place on the stack.
</pre>

This code now takes 11 bytes. Notice how it is somewhat troublesome to
keep track of where variables are at every point in time. This is why
we typically use a BP register; it simplifies coding sequences like
this tremendously by providing a fixed reference position.

To choose the size of the constant for a serious design, we would have
to analyze our system by running some benchmarks and see how far most
away from memory most loads and stores are at.  For example, if we
could reach 40% of our source and destination addresses with 1 byte,
but 90% with two bytes, then we would probably opt to have the
constant be two bytes.  However, if in 1 byte we could reach 40% of
our source and destination addresses, but with even two, three and
even four bytes, reach 50%, then it would not be worth it to increase
the number of bytes.

Propose simple instructions that allow space for variables (like A, B,
C, and D) to be allocated on the stack and subsequently deallocated
when they are no longer needed.

We want to make a stack version of our beta allocate and deallocate.  Therefore:

<pre>
ALLOCATE:
Usage: ALLOCATE &lt;1 byte unsigned literal, the # of words to allocate&gt;
SP = SP + 4*literal
PC = PC+4
 
DEALLOCATE:
Usage: DEALLOCATE &lt;1 byte unsigned literal, the # of words to deallocate&gt;
SP = SP - 4*literal
PC = PC +4
</pre>
 
Note: we used unsigned literals since we don't need to represent both
positive #s AND negative #'s, and we can get twice the range by using
unsigned numbers.
 
<p/>It would be acceptable if the argument to allocate/deallocate was
taken from the stack, rather than an argument.

    <div id="question7H" class="question">
    <ol type="A" start="8"><li>
    
Typical stack machines also hide the PC from explicit program access,
providing CALL and RETURN instructions to be used for procedure calls.
At minimum, such instructions copy values between the PC and the
stack.

<p/>Devise simple, single-byte CALL and RETURN instructions that allow
a procedure having no arguments to be called and to return to its
caller.  Describe the operation of each instruction.

<div id="control7H" class="control" style="padding-top: 8px; padding-bottom: 8px">

If we do not need to pass any arguments, then we do not need to push
arguments onto the stack, and in fact, all we care about is that we
can go to another procedure, and that it returns to us.  Therefore:

<pre>
CALL:
Usage: CALL &lt;4 byte absolute (unsigned) address&gt;
Mem[SP] = PC + 4
SP = SP + 4
PC = absolute address
</pre> 
It would also be acceptable if the call had no argument and took the
address from the stack.
<pre> 
RETURN: 
Usage: RETURN
SP = SP - 4
PC = Mem[SP]

    <div id="question7I" class="question">
    <ol type="A" start="9"><li>
    
Finally, consider using your SP-relative load and store instructions
to implement stack frames on our little stack machine.  Your job is to
devise and describe conventions to be followed by caller and callee
allowing (i) arguments to be passed from the caller to the callee,
(ii) local variables to be allocated and used by the callee, and (iii)
a single value to be returned from the callee to the caller.

<p/>To be concrete, consider the following procedure and its call:

<pre>int F(int a, int b)
 { int x;
   x = a*b;
   return (x + x*b)
 }
...
z = F(23, 41);
...
</pre>

<p/>The natural place to return the value of the procedure is on the
stack, but it is awkward to allocate this location in the caller
because it blocks access to the return value.  How does your proposed
convention deal with this problem?

<div id="control7I" class="control" style="padding-top: 8px; padding-bottom: 8px">
        <a href="#" onClick="toggle('7I'); return false">
          <img name="ctl7I" class="hideshow" src="show.gif" border="0"/>
        </a></div> <div id="answer7I" class="answer" style="display:none"><font color="blue">
We have to make sure the return value on the stack is accessible to
the callee as well as placed before the return value on the stack.  If
the callee always knows how many values it has pushed onto the stack,
and it knows the last two things on the stack before it was called is
the return value followed by the return address, then it can use
STORE-SP to store the value onto the return value.

This is somewhat unpleasant, due to the fact that every time we do
almost anything, we change the value of the stack pointer (since every
operation modifies the stack in some way), which changes the offsets
for the variables.
 
<p/>Drawing a careful diagram of the stack while working this problem
is essential.
<pre>
F:
    ALLOCATE(1)   | reserve room for x
    LOAD-SR(4)    | fetch a

    LOAD-SR(6)    | load b
