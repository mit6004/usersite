	  Someone picks a name out of a hat known to contain the names of 5
	  women and 3 men, and tells you a man has been selected.
	  How much information have they given you about the selection?
	  
	  <div id="control1A" class="control" style="padding-top: 8px; padding-bottom: 8px">
            <a href="#" onClick="toggle('1A'); return false">
          <img name="ctl1A" class="hideshow" src="show.gif" border="0"/>
          </a></div> <div id="answer1A" class="answer" style="display:none"><font color="blue">
	      There are 8 names to start with and knowing the selection is a man
	      narrows the choices down to 3 names.  Using the formula from lecture
	      with N = 8 and M = 3, we've been given log<sub>2</sub>(8/3) bits
	      of information.
	      
	      <p/>Alternatively, the probability of drawing a man's name is p<sub>man</sub> =
	      3/8, so the amount of information received is log<sub>2</sub>(1/p<sub>man</sub>) =
	      log<sub>2</sub>(1/(3/8)) = log<sub>2</sub>(8/3).
