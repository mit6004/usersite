<q:question>
In lecture, we saw an enumeration of FSMs having the property that
every FSM that can be built is equivalent to some FSM in that enumeration.

<q:subquestion>
We didn't deal with FSMs having different numbers of inputs and
outputs.  Where will we find a 5-input, 3-output FSM in our
enumeration?

<q:answer>
We find a 5-input, 5-output FSM and don't use the extra outputs.

</q:answer>
</q:subquestion>
<q:subquestion>
Can we also enumerate finite combinational logic functions?  If so,
describe such an enumeration; if not, explain your reasoning.

<q:answer>
Yes.  One approach is to enumerate ROMs, in much the same
way as we did for the logic in our FSMs.   For single-output
functions, we can enumerate 1-input truth tables, 2-input truth
tables, etc.  This can clearly be extended to multiple outputs, as
was done in lecture.

<p/>An alternative approach is to enumerate (say) all possible acyclic
circuits using 2-input NAND gates.

<q:subquestion>
Why do 6-3s think they own this enumeration trick?  Can we come
up with a scheme for enumerating functions of continuous variables,
e.g. an enumeration that will include things like sin(x), op amps,
etc?

<q:answer>
No.  The thing that makes enumeration work is the finite number
of combination functions there are for each number of inputs.
There are only 16 2-input combinational functions; but there are
infinitely many continuous 2-input functions.  This makes
enumeration impossible.

We saw that certain functions, such as parentheses checking, cannot be
performed by any finite state machine.  Which of the following can be
performed by an FSM?  Assume, in each case, that the device is to take
a series of 0s and 1s that represent the digits of a binary number
entered left-to-right.  The device is to have a single output, which
is 1 only under the specified conditions:

When the last 277 digits entered have been alternate 1s and 0s.

<q:answer>
Yes.  Its a bit tedious for 277 digits, but you should be
able to sketch one for 3 or 4 digits.

When more 0s than 1s have been entered.

When the number entered corresponds to a year in which the
Red Sox win the world series.

<q:answer>
(Easy answer: always 0!).
Assuming there are a bounded number of such years (otherwise, dream
on...) its easy to design such an FSM from a list of the years.

<q:question>
Recall that we refer to a Turing machine's tape configuration 
as bounded if all 1s recorded on the tape are within some finite
distance from the initial head position.  We saw in lecture that
every bounded tape configuration can be viewed as an encoding of
a binary number, and that a TM can be said to compute the integer
function f if, for every n, starting that TM with a tape encoding 
n will result in its halting with the tape encoding f(n).
 
 
<q:subquestion>
Given TMs that compute f(x) and g(x), respectively, describe how to
construct a TM that computes f(g(x)). 
 
<q:answer>
Since TMs differ only in their FSMs, we need show only how to
construct the FSM for the new TM.  To do so, we make a new state
transition diagram which incorporates the STDs of both machines.
However, we replace the Halt state of the machine that computes g(x)
with the initial state of the one computing f(x).  The initial state
of the new machine is the initial state of the g(x) machine, while its
Halt state is the Halt state of the machine computing f(x).
 
<p/>The resulting machine will perform the computation g(x) on its input,
leaving the result (say, y) as its tape configuration, and then go on
to perform f(y) which is left as the final tape configuration.  Thus
it computes f(g(x)).

<img src="star.gif" alt="Discussed in section"/>
Ben Bitdiddle's proposed Ph.D. thesis involves writing a program to
compute a function f(x) on a Cray supercomputer. Ben's advisor points
out that f cannot be computed on any Turing machine. Should Ben care?
Why?

<q:answer>
If the function can't be computed on any Turing machine, then it
can't be computed on any physically realizable machine that we
know of.  So Ben is out of luck... a Cray supercomputer isn't
"super" in that sense.

</q:answer>
</q:subquestion>
<q:subquestion>
<img src="star.gif" alt="Discussed in section"/>
Discouraged by your answer to the last question, Ben has turned his
attention to an alternative thesis topic. He now proposes to invent
the universal FSM, which will be to FSMs what a universal Turing
machine is to Turing machines. Ben's idea is to build an FSM that can
fed a sequence of inputs describing any other FSM and the inputs to
that FSM. The universal FSM would then emulate the behavior of the
described FSM on the specified inputs. Is Ben's idea workable? Why or
why not?

<q:answer>
Unfortunately, the Universal FSM will have some fixed number (N) of
states built into its design.  So it won't have enough states to
emulate machines with more than N states.  Ben's idea isn't workable.

We saw in lecture that the function Halts(k, j) which determines
whether TM k halts with the argument j is uncomputable.  For each of
the following functions, describe whether that function is computable
or not and explain your reasoning.

<q:subquestion>

HaltsBefore(k, j, s) = 1 if TM k halts with argument j within
s steps, else 0.

<q:answer>
Computable, simply by simulating TMk[j] for s steps, much
as a universal TM does.

<q:subquestion>
<img src="star.gif" alt="Discussed in section"/>
HZero(k) which determines whether TM k halts with the argument
zero.  Hence HZero(k) returns 1 iff TM k (0) halts, else 0.
[HINT: this is tricky].

<q:answer>
Uncomputable.
Let g(x, y) = i where i is the index of a TM which writes y on
its tape and then executes the function of TM x on the result.
Hence, starting with a blank (zero) input tape, TMi will
compute the same result as TMx operating on input tape y.
g(x, y) is clearly computable.

<p/>If HZero is computable, then Halts(k, j) = HZero(g(k, j)).
Since we know Halts is uncomputable, HZero must be as well.

H12345(x) which determines whether TM 12345 halts with the
argument 12345.

<q:answer>
H12345(x) is a function that always returns true or always
returns false, independently of its argument.  In either case,
the function is computable -- even if we can't determine which of these
two choices is the correct definition.

Dow(y) = the final value of the Dow Jones average on the last
trading day of the year 2000+y, for y &lt; 100 (and zero for y &gt;= 100).

<q:answer>
This function can be implemented as a simple table lookup
given a 100-entry table.   It is clearly computable, although
we don't won't know what the values in the table are for another
100 years.

<q:question>
In the following problems consider a Turing machines with the
following specifications. Each Turing machine has n states labeled
{S1, S2, ..., Sn}, the Turing machine begins in state S1 and halts by
transitioning to the special state S0, each cell of the Turing
machine's tape can contain either a "1" or a "0", and each move of the
Turing machine based solely on its current state and the value of the
tape cell under the tape head. A move consists of first modifying the
contents of the current tape cell under the head of the Turing
machine, moving the tape either left, L, or right, R, followed by a
transition to the next state.

<p/>The following truth table defines the behavior of a Turing machine.
Note that in this FSM the outputs are a function of both the current
state and the tape value.

<q:subquestion>
How large a ROM is required to implement an n-state Turing machine
that adheres to the given specification (give the number of words and
the bits-per-word)?

<q:answer>
There are n+1 states (including S0), which will take ceil{log2(n+1)} bits
to encode. Adding the "Tape Value"
input, there are ceil{log2(n+1)} + 1 inputs total, thus
<nobr>2<sup>ceil{log2(n+1)}+1</sup></nobr> = 2(n+1) rows in the ROM.

<p/>Each row encodes a bit for "Write Tape", a bit for "Move", and
<nobr>ceil{log2(n+1)}</nobr> bits (counting S0) for the "Next State" for a total of
<nobr>ceil{log2(n+1)}+2</nobr> bits per row. Thus, the size of the ROM is
<nobr>2(n+1) x (ceil{log2(n+1)}+2)</nobr> bits.

Given an infinite tape (in both directions), with "0"s in every
cell. What will the Turing machine described by the truth table above

The highlighted square represents the current position of the head.

Design a 2-state Turing Machine that writes as many "1"s as possible
onto an all zero (in both directions) tape and then halts.  Hint: you
can write four "1"s.

<q:answer>
The following 2-state FSM can write 4 ones:

<p/><img src="computation03.gif"/>

</q:answer>
</q:subquestion>
<q:subquestion>
Suppose that we choose to ignore the value of the cell under the read
head, thus turning our Turing machine into a finite-state machine. In
this case, how many "1"s can we write if the FSM has n states?

<q:answer>
If we don't really care which direction we're writing in, and we want
to write the largest (but finite) number of ones, an n state FSM can
succeed only in writing n ones. The states essentially amount to a
counter.

<p/>An n state FSM can write an infinite number of ones (even if n=1),
provided it wasn't required to halt.

<q:question>
<b>"Extra Credit" -- hard problem.</b>

<p/>Given the uncomputability of the halting problem for arbitrary TMs,
lets consider the halting problem for FSMs.

<p/>Assume that Fi(x) is the ith FSM in our FSM enumeration, where the
first input is given the successive binary digits of x from
low-to-high order and zeros thereafter.  Thus x represents an input
sequence containing a bounded number of 1s.  All other inputs to the
FSM are tied to 0.

<p/>We interpret the first output of the FSM as the "Halt" signal -- if
it ever becomes 1, the computation stops and Fi(x) is said to halt.

<q:subquestion>
Consider the function FSMHalts(x, y) which returns 1 if Fx(y)
halts, else 0.  Is FSMHalts a computable function?

<q:answer>
Yes.  We can simulate FSM x operating on input y.  We have
to detect loops somehow, to avoid having FSMHalts loop forever
given a looping FSM. We can do this by  keeping
a record (as a list, requiring unbounded memory for arbitrary x)
of every state in its history along with the remaining input at
that point in its computation, and checking at every step whether
we've ever been here before.
