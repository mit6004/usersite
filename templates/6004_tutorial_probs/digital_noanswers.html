    <p/><hr/><p/><u>Problem 5.</u>
    
<i>Barracks logic</i> is built out of sleeping soldiers covered by
electric blankets. Each blanket has a control switch with discrete
control settings ranging in 5-degree (Fahrenheit) intervals from 0 to 50
degrees. The temperature of a soldier covered by one or more electric blankets
will be the sum of the ambient temperature in the barracks
plus the setting on the controller for each blanket.

<p/>Each soldier has a preferred sleeping temperature, which varies from
individual to individual but is always within the range of 60 to 80
degrees, inclusive. If a soldier's temperature departs from
her preferred temperature, the soldier will wake up once
every minute and adjust the control by one 5-degree increment in the
appropriate direction (if the solider is cold, the solider will
increase the setting on the control, and vice versa).  The soldier will
continue these adjustments by 5-degree increments until she once again reaches
her preferred temperature (and goes to sleep) or runs out of settings (in
which case she grumbles angrily in bed).

<p/>If soldiers are allowed to control their own blankets, each will
soon reach their preferred temperature and slide into nocturnal bliss
(assuming a suitable ambient temperature).  The interesting aspects
of barracks logic result from switching the controls of the various
blankets to different soldiers.  Inputs to the system are
accomplished by placing a few controls in the hands of outsiders, and
outputs are read from the control settings of certain soldiers
designated by the logic designer.

Bread and Circuits, Inc. has discovered an interesting electronic
device (a Z-module) which is made using a single yeast cell, a speck
of flour, and a grain of salt.  The Z-module has two inputs carrying
voltages VA and VB and a single output carrying VC.  The output VC
settles, after a 10ns period of stable input voltages, to the product
of the input voltages restricted to range of 0V to 2V.  In other

He suspects that a Z-module, under the appropriate logic conventions,

Ivan's been at it for several weeks and needs your help.

<p/>Can you find a way to use a Z-module for an AND or OR combinational

the Z-module can't be used as AND or OR.

Ivan sidesteps the previous enigma by allowing himself the use of
several Z-modules as components of a single logic gate.  He assumes
(and you may too) that noise enters the system only between logic
gates, not between the components of a single gate.  He notes that
each of B&amp;C's proposed buffers (using one Z-module) is an amplifier
with gain greater than one.  Ivan reasons that by cascading many such
devices (as shown below), he can achieve arbitrarily high gain and
hence excellent noise margins.

<p/><center><img src="digital12.gif"/></center> 
 
<p/>His plan is to use such a high-gain cascade on the output of a
Z-module to restore the validity of marginal signal levels.  Describe
the voltage transfer characteristic (i.e, VIN vs. VOUT) of a cascade
of a large number of Z-modules (via an expression or sketch).

    <p/><hr/><p/><u>Problem 7.</u>
    
<b>Combinational construction rules</b>

<p/>In lecture, we learned two basic principles regarding the class of
combinational devices.  The first allows us to build a combinational
device from, e.g., electronic components:

<ul>
<li>A <i>combinational device</i> is a circuit element that has
<ul>
<li>one or more digital <i>inputs</i></li>
<li>one or more digital <i>outputs</i></li>
<li>a <i>functional specification</i> that details the value of each
output for every possible combination of valid input values</li>
<li>a <i>timing specification</i> consisting (at minimum) of an upper
bound t<sub>pd</sub> on the required time for the device to compute
the specified output values from an arbitrary set of stable, valid
input values.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p/>while the second allows us to construct complex combinational
devices from acyclic circuits containing simpler ones:

<ul>
<li>A set of interconnected elements is a combinational device if
<ul>
<li>each circuit element is combinational</li>
<li>every input is connected to exactly one output or to some vast
supply of 0's and 1's</li>
<li>the circuit contains no directed cycles</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p/>In this problem, we ask you to think carefully about why these rules
work - in particular, why an acyclic circuit of combinational devices,
constructed according to the second principle, is itself a
combinational device as defined by the first.  You may assume for the
following that every input and output is a logical 0 or 1.

<p/>Consider the following 2-input acyclic circuit whose two
components, A and B, are each combinational devices:

<p/><center><img src="digital01.gif"/></center>

<p/>The propagation delay - the upper bound on the output settling time
- for each device is specified in nanoseconds.  The functional
specifications for each component are given as truth tables detailing
output values for each combination of inputs:
