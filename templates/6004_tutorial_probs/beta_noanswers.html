In an unpipelined Beta implementation, when executing a

be set to?

The minimum clock period of the unpipelined Beta implementation
is determined by the propagation delays of the data path elements and
the amount of time it takes for the control signals to become valid.
Which of the following select signals should become valid first in
order to ensure the smallest possible clock period: PCSEL, RA2SEL,
ASEL, BSEL, WDSEL, WASEL?

    <div id="question2" class="question">
    <p/><hr/><p/><u>Problem 2.</u>
    
Notta Kalew, a somewhat fumble-fingered lab assistant, has deleted the
opcode field from the following table describing the control logic of
an unpipelined Beta processor.

<p/><img src="beta03.gif"/>


    <div id="question2A" class="question">
    <ol type="A" start="1"><li>
    
<img src="star.gif" alt="Discussed in section"/>
Help Notta out by identifying which Beta instruction is implemented by
each row of the table.


</li></ol></div>

    <div id="question2B" class="question">
    <ol type="A" start="2"><li>
    
<img src="star.gif" alt="Discussed in section"/>
Notta notices that WASEL is always zero in this table.  Explain
briefly under what circumstances WASEL would be non-zero.


</li></ol></div>

    <div id="question2C" class="question">
    <ol type="A" start="3"><li>
    
<img src="star.gif" alt="Discussed in section"/>
Notta has noticed the following C code fragment appears frequently in the benchmarks:

<pre>   int *p;     /* Pointer to integer array */
   int i,j;    /* integer variables */
   ...
   j = p[i];   /* access ith element of array */
</pre>

<p/>The pointer variable p contains the address of a dynamically
allocated array of integers.  The value of p[i] is stored at the
address Mem[p]+4*Mem[i] where p and i are locations containing the values of
the corresponding C variables.  On a conventional Beta this code
fragment is translated to the following instruction sequence:

<pre>   LD(...,R1)     /* R1 contains p, the array base address */
   LD(...,R2)     /* R2 contains I, the array index */
   ...
   SHLC(R2,2,R0)  /* compute byte-addressed offset = 4*i */
   ADD(R1,R0,R0)  /* address of indexed element */
   LD(R0,0,R3)    /* fetch p[i] into R3 */
</pre>

<p/>Notta proposes the addition of an LDX instruction that shortens the
last three instructions to

<pre>
   SHLC(R2,2,R0)  /* compute byte-addressed offset = 4*i */
   LDX(R0,R1,R3)  /* fetch p[i] into R3 */
</pre>

<p/>Give a register-transfer language description for the LDX
instruction.  Examples of register-transfer language descriptions can
be for other Beta instructions in the Beta Documentation handed out in
lecture.


</li></ol></div>

    <div id="question2D" class="question">
    <ol type="A" start="4"><li>
    
<img src="star.gif" alt="Discussed in section"/>
Using a table like the one above specify the control signals for the LDX opcode.


</li></ol></div>

    <div id="question2E" class="question">
    <ol type="A" start="5"><li>
    
It occurs to Notta that adding an STX instruction would probably be
useful too.  Using this new instruction, p[i] = j might compile into
the following instruction sequence:

<pre>   SHLC(R2,2,R0)  /* compute byte-addressed offset = 4*i */
   STX(R3,R0,R1)  /* R3 contains j, R1 contains p */
</pre>

<p/>Briefly describe what modifications to the Beta datapath would be
necessary to be able to execute STX in a single cycle.

    <p/><hr/><p/><u>Problem 3.</u>
    
One Beta manufacturer is having quality-control problems with their
design. In particular, they've had reliability issues with various
device connections that are circled in the attached diagram.

<p/>Your job is to write some test programs to help determine if a
machine is fault-free.  Assume that when a device connection is
"faulty," the indicated bus or signal is always "stuck-at 0" instead
of the expected value.  For each of the circled connections, write an
instruction sequence that when executed for a specified number of
cycles would indicate whether the connection was okay by leaving a "1"
in R0 and leaves some other value in R0 if the connection was faulty.
You can assume that all registers are reliably set to 0 before each
sequence is executed.

<p/>Give your instruction sequence for each of the six indicated faults
and briefly explain how each sequence detects the fault and produces
something besides "1" in R0 when the fault is present.

Flaky Beta's, Inc. has an interesting business plan: they
buy -- very cheaply -- Beta processors manufactured by other companies
with slight defects and market them as implementing "variants" of the
Beta Instruction Set Architecture.  FBI's plan is simply to change the
documentation of the instructions affected by the manufacturing flaws
in each machine, presuming that its customers can live with the
revised machine behavior.

<p/>The FB1 and FB2 are based on a non-pipelined Beta.  They perform
exactly as a fully functional non- pipelined Beta (see diagrams at the
end of the quiz), except for the following flaws:

<ul>
The FB1 has the select input to the ASEL mux stuck at 0, causing the register file to always be selected 
as the A (left) input to the ALU.

<p/>The FB2 has the select input to the RA2SEL mux stuck at 0, causing
the Rb field of the instruction to always be selected as the RA2
(right) address input to the register file.
</ul>

<p/>Note that, aside from the above flaws, the defective processors
behave identically to their fully-functional counterparts; control
signals, for example, are generated as for a working Beta processor.

<p/>FBI tests both the FB1 and FB2 on six Beta instructions: LDR, ST,
SUBC, BNE, LD and JMP.  They find that each of the flaws affects only
one of the six instructions.


    <div id="question4A" class="question">

Of course many programs use all the instructions in the Beta ISA,
so clients need to know if it is possible to rewrite their programs so
that they perform the same computation whether they run on an unflawed
Beta or an FBI processor.  It's okay if the rewritten program takes a
different number of instructions than the original.  When answering
the questions below, assume that rewritten programs still fit in the
available memory.

<p/>Is it possible to rewrite an arbitrary program so that it will
perform correctly on both an unflawed Beta and an FB1?
