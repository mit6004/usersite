    <div id="question1" class="question">
    <p/><hr/><p/><u>Problem 1.</u>
    
A computer system has three devices whose
characteristics are summarized in the following table:

<p/><center><table border="1" cellspacing="3">
<tr><th>Device</th><th>Service Time</th><th>Interrupt Frequency</th><th>Allowable Latency</th></tr>
<tr><td>D1</td><td>400 us</td><td>1/(800us)</td><td>400us</td></tr>
<tr><td>D2</td><td>250 us</td><td>1/(1000us)</td><td>50us</td></tr>
<tr><td>D3</td><td>100 us</td><td>1/(800us)</td><td>300us</td></tr>
</table></center>

<p/>Service time indicates how long it takes to run the interrupt
handler for each device.  The maximum time allowed to elapse between
an interrupt request and the start of the interrupt handler is
indicated by allowable latency.


    <div id="question1A" class="question">
    <ol type="A" start="1"><li>
    
If a program P takes 100 seconds to execute when interrupts are
disabled, how long will P take to run when interrupts are enabled?


</li></ol></div>

    <div id="question1B" class="question">
    <ol type="A" start="2"><li>
    
Can the requirements given in the table above be met using a
weak priority ordering among the interrupt requests?


</li></ol></div>

    <div id="question1C" class="question">
    <ol type="A" start="3"><li>
    
Can the requirements given in the table above be met using a
strong priority ordering among the interrupt requests?


</li></ol></div>
</div>

    <div id="question2" class="question">
    <p/><hr/><p/><u>Problem 2.</u>
    
Surreal Time Systems is configuring a Beta for a dedicated application
involving three I/O devices whose characteristics are summarized below:

<p/><center><table border="1" cellspacing="3">
<tr><th>Device</th><th>Interrupt Frequency</th><th>Service Time</th></tr>
<tr><td>A</td><td>1/(1000 us)</td><td>600 us</td></tr>
<tr><td>B</td><td>1/(500 us)</td><td>100 us</td></tr>
<tr><td>C</td><td>1/(1000000 us)</td><td>100000 us</td></tr>
</table></center>

<p/>Each of the three devices causes periodic interrupts as the given
frequency.  Each interrupt requires the service time specified for
that device.  When the processor is not servicing any interrupt, it
runs a compute-bound user-mode (background) task L which composes
limericks like

<ul><i>There was an old lady from Crewe<br/>
whose limericks stopped at line two.</i>
</ul>

<p/>For each of the following questions, assume all devices are
requesting service at their maximum rate.


    <div id="question2A" class="question">
    <ol type="A" start="1"><li>
    
Assuming no interrupt priorities, what is the approximate worst-case
latency seen by each device?


</li></ol></div>

    <div id="question2B" class="question">
    <ol type="A" start="2"><li>
    
Now assume that each interrupt handler must complete execution before
the next request from the same device in order to avoid losing data.  To
accommodate this real time constraint, the processor is enhanced with a
4-level strong priority system with priorities 0 (background), 1, 2 and
3 (highest).  What priorities would you assign to each device?


</li></ol></div>

    <div id="question2C" class="question">
    <ol type="A" start="3"><li>
    
Suppose that, in the absence of interrupts, L composes an average
of 100 limericks per hour.  What is its rate when all three devices are
interrupting?


</li></ol></div>
</div>

    <div id="question3" class="question">
    <p/><hr/><p/><u>Problem 3.</u>
    
A computer system is interfaced to four devices: a printer, a disk,
a keyboard, and a display.  The characteristics of the devices are
summarized in the following table.

<p/><table border="1" cellspacing="4">
<tr><td>Device</td><td>Interrupt service time</td><td>Interrupt
frequency</td><td>response-time requirement</td></tr>
<tr><td>Printer</td><td>1000 us</td><td>1/(2000 us)</td><td>1000 us</td></tr>
<tr><td>Disk</td><td>300 us</td><td>1/(1000 us)</td><td>200 us</td></tr>
<tr><td>Keyboard</td><td>2000 us</td><td>1/(100000 us)</td><td>2000 us</td></tr>
<tr><td>Display</td><td>100 us</td><td>1/(1000 us)</td><td>200 us</td></tr>
</table>


    <div id="question3A" class="question">
    <ol type="A" start="1"><li>
    
A program P, which performs only computation (no input/output),
takes 100 s to run when no input/output is being performed.  How long
will it take for P to run when all of the above devices are
operating at their maximum speeds?


</li></ol></div>

    <div id="question3B" class="question">
    <ol type="A" start="2"><li>
    
Suppose that the interrupt system enforces a nonpreemptive
(weak) priority ordering printer &gt; disk &gt; keyboard &gt; display
among interrupt requests.  Assuming the characteristics given in the
table above, what is the maximum time that might elapse between a disk
interrupt request and execution of the first instruction of its
handler?  Assume that the time taken for state save and context switch
is negligible.

    <div id="question3C" class="question">
    <ol type="A" start="3"><li>
    
Can the requirements given in the table above be met using a

give such an ordering; if not, explain.
