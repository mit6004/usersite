eliminating any components (pulldowns, wires, and inverters) that are
unused or redundant.  Components are eliminated -- replaced by open
circuits -- until no further components can be removed without

    <p/><hr/><p/><u>Problem 9.</u>
    
Digital Widgets Co. has introduced a new logic IC consisting of two
comparator cells in a 14-pin package.  A comparator cell, as drawn
below, has four inputs and two outputs.

<p/><img src="logic05.gif"/>

<p/>The inputs are labeled An, Bn, Gn+1, and Ln+1, and the outputs are
labeled Gn and Ln.  The G and L signals have the meanings "A greater
than B" and "A less than B," respectively.  If both G and L are false,
the meaning is A = B.  G and L are never both true.  Two k-bit numbers
A and B may be compared using a circuit such as the following:

<p/><img src="logic06.gif"/>

<p/>The most significant bits are supplied as Ak-1 and
Bk-1, and the least significant bits are A0 and B0.

<p/>The output of a comparison is taken from the G and L outputs of the
lowest-order cell (G0 and L0).  Gn+1 and Ln+1 of the highest-order
cell are connected to logical 0 to indicate that the numbers are
assumed to be equal until some difference is found between a pair of
bits Ai and Bi.

<p/>If the Gn+1 and Ln+1 inputs indicate that higher-order bits have
established A &gt; B or A &lt; B, then cell n must propagate that
result to Gn and Ln.  However, if Gn+1 and Ln+1 indicate that the
higher-order bits are equal, then cell n must compare its bit of A and
B to determine if A &gt; B, A &lt; B, or A = B and must signal that
result appropriately at Gn and Ln.

Since there is delay associated with the propagation of the G and L
signals through each cell, we could make the comparator work faster
by redesigning the basic cell to compare two bits at a time, halving the number
of stages through which the G and L signals will need to propagate.

<p/><img src="logic07.gif"/>

<p/>Work out expressions for Gn and Ln as functions of Gn+2, Ln+2,
An+1, Bn+1, An, and Bn.  Express your answers in the form

<p/><img src="logic08.gif"/>


</li></ol></div>

    <div id="question9C" class="question">
    <ol type="A" start="3"><li>
    
Given a reasonable implementation of the equations for Gn and Ln
derived in part B, how does the delay from a change in Gn+2
and Ln+2 to the appearance of correct outputs at Gn
and Ln compare with the corresponding delay for a circuit composed
of a cascade of two of the cells developed in part A?  
Assume that all A and B inputs remain unchanged throughout.

<p/><font size="1">
<i>Note:</i> The reason for our interest in the propagation delay of the G and
L signals, specifically, is that in a chain of N comparators, every
extra gate delay in the G--L path will penalize total performance by N
gate delays.  The time it takes for a change in an A or B input to be reflected
in the corresponding G or L output is also important, but improvements here
can at best result in decreasing total delay by some constant amount.
