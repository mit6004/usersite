In lecture, we saw an enumeration of FSMs having the property that
every FSM that can be built is equivalent to some FSM in that enumeration.


    <div id="question1A" class="question">
    <ol type="A" start="1"><li>
    
We didn't deal with FSMs having different numbers of inputs and
outputs.  Where will we find a 5-input, 3-output FSM in our
enumeration?


</li></ol></div>

    <div id="question1B" class="question">
    <ol type="A" start="2"><li>
    
Can we also enumerate finite combinational logic functions?  If so,
describe such an enumeration; if not, explain your reasoning.

    <ol type="A" start="3"><li>
    
Why do 6-3s think they own this enumeration trick?  Can we come
up with a scheme for enumerating functions of continuous variables,
e.g. an enumeration that will include things like sin(x), op amps,
etc?

We saw that certain functions, such as parentheses checking, cannot be
performed by any finite state machine.  Which of the following can be
performed by an FSM?  Assume, in each case, that the device is to take
a series of 0s and 1s that represent the digits of a binary number
entered left-to-right.  The device is to have a single output, which
is 1 only under the specified conditions:


    <div id="question2A" class="question">
    <ol type="A" start="1"><li>

When the last 277 digits entered have been alternate 1s and 0s.

    <div id="question2B" class="question">
    <ol type="A" start="2"><li>

    <div id="question2C" class="question">

    <p/><hr/><p/><u>Problem 3.</u>
    
Recall that we refer to a Turing machine's tape configuration 
as bounded if all 1s recorded on the tape are within some finite
distance from the initial head position.  We saw in lecture that
every bounded tape configuration can be viewed as an encoding of
a binary number, and that a TM can be said to compute the integer
function f if, for every n, starting that TM with a tape encoding 
n will result in its halting with the tape encoding f(n).
 
 

    <div id="question3A" class="question">
    <ol type="A" start="1"><li>
    
Given TMs that compute f(x) and g(x), respectively, describe how to
construct a TM that computes f(g(x)).

<img src="star.gif" alt="Discussed in section"/>
Ben Bitdiddle's proposed Ph.D. thesis involves writing a program to
compute a function f(x) on a Cray supercomputer. Ben's advisor points
out that f cannot be computed on any Turing machine. Should Ben care?
Why?

Discouraged by your answer to the last question, Ben has turned his
attention to an alternative thesis topic. He now proposes to invent
the universal FSM, which will be to FSMs what a universal Turing
machine is to Turing machines. Ben's idea is to build an FSM that can
fed a sequence of inputs describing any other FSM and the inputs to
that FSM. The universal FSM would then emulate the behavior of the
described FSM on the specified inputs. Is Ben's idea workable? Why or
why not?

We saw in lecture that the function Halts(k, j) which determines
whether TM k halts with the argument j is uncomputable.  For each of
the following functions, describe whether that function is computable
or not and explain your reasoning.

HaltsBefore(k, j, s) = 1 if TM k halts with argument j within
s steps, else 0.

In the following problems consider a Turing machines with the
following specifications. Each Turing machine has n states labeled
{S1, S2, ..., Sn}, the Turing machine begins in state S1 and halts by
transitioning to the special state S0, each cell of the Turing
machine's tape can contain either a "1" or a "0", and each move of the
Turing machine based solely on its current state and the value of the
tape cell under the tape head. A move consists of first modifying the
contents of the current tape cell under the head of the Turing
machine, moving the tape either left, L, or right, R, followed by a
transition to the next state.

<p/>The following truth table defines the behavior of a Turing machine.
Note that in this FSM the outputs are a function of both the current
state and the tape value.

Given an infinite tape (in both directions), with "0"s in every
cell. What will the Turing machine described by the truth table above
leave on the tape when it halts? Show the status of the tape in the

Design a 2-state Turing Machine that writes as many "1"s as possible
onto an all zero (in both directions) tape and then halts.  Hint: you
can write four "1"s.

Suppose that we choose to ignore the value of the cell under the read
head, thus turning our Turing machine into a finite-state machine. In
this case, how many "1"s can we write if the FSM has n states?

<b>"Extra Credit" -- hard problem.</b>

<p/>Given the uncomputability of the halting problem for arbitrary TMs,
lets consider the halting problem for FSMs.

<p/>Assume that Fi(x) is the ith FSM in our FSM enumeration, where the
first input is given the successive binary digits of x from
low-to-high order and zeros thereafter.  Thus x represents an input
sequence containing a bounded number of 1s.  All other inputs to the
FSM are tied to 0.

<p/>We interpret the first output of the FSM as the "Halt" signal -- if
it ever becomes 1, the computation stops and Fi(x) is said to halt.


    <div id="question7A" class="question">
    <ol type="A" start="1"><li>
    
Consider the function FSMHalts(x, y) which returns 1 if Fx(y)
halts, else 0.  Is FSMHalts a computable function?
